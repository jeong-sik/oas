---- MODULE RuntimeCheckpointOrder ----
\* Models runtime checkpoint ordering.
\*
\* Concrete code:
\*   - Runtime_store.save_snapshot
\*   - Runtime_store.append_event Checkpoint_saved
\*
\* The event log must never claim Checkpoint_saved unless the snapshot
\* write has already succeeded. An extra snapshot without an event is
\* acceptable after an append failure; an event without a snapshot is not.
\*
\* Bug model: BugAppendEventBeforeSnapshot models the old ordering where
\* Checkpoint_saved was appended before save_snapshot could fail.
