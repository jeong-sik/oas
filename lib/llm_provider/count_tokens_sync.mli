(** Synchronous provider-native input-token count transport.

    This module owns endpoint selection, request construction dispatch, and
    transport execution for input-token counting — the pieces that
    {!Input_token_count} deliberately keeps outside its decoding boundary.

    @stability Internal *)

    [/count_tokens] after the configured request path, preserving any query
    string carried by custom or proxy configurations. *)
val count_tokens_url : Provider_config.t -> string

(** Count one Anthropic Messages input through the provider's native
    [/v1/messages/count_tokens] endpoint.

    The request reuses {!Backend_anthropic}'s completion input projection.
    Non-Anthropic configs fail with [Unsupported] before any I/O.

    The call is bounded only when [timeout_s] is explicitly supplied;
    enforcing it also requires [clock], mirroring {!Http_client.post_sync}. *)

(** Exact provider-owned measurement of one fully prepared completion request.

    The caller supplies the immutable {!Llm_transport.completion_request} that
    reached its transport boundary, after Agent turn hooks, tool projection,
    and caller-owned message projection. The input count uses the provider's
    native count endpoint. The output receipt comes from the opaque completion
    request artifact built from the same config, messages, and tools.

    This is a lower-level transport-adapter primitive. Application callers
    must not reconstruct a completion request to call it: final Agent-level
    fit admission must measure the same opaque prepared request that it later
    dispatches. This function neither dispatches nor returns that artifact, so
    its receipt alone does not prove a later dispatch reused the measured
    request value.

    Unsupported provider protocols fail before I/O. No character estimate,
    context-window fallback, fit policy, retry, or truncation is performed. *)
