(** Synchronous provider-native input-token count transport.

    This module owns endpoint selection, request construction dispatch, and
    transport execution for input-token counting — the pieces that
    {!Input_token_count} deliberately keeps outside its decoding boundary.

    @stability Internal *)

    [/count_tokens] after the configured request path, preserving any query
    string carried by custom or proxy configurations. *)
val count_tokens_url : Provider_config.t -> string

(** Count one Anthropic-compatible Messages input through the provider's
    native [/v1/messages/count_tokens] endpoint.

    The request reuses {!Backend_anthropic}'s provider-specific completion
    input projection. Anthropic and Kimi configs are supported; other configs
    fail with [Unsupported] before any I/O.

    The call is bounded only when [timeout_s] is explicitly supplied;
    enforcing it also requires [clock], mirroring {!Http_client.post_sync}. *)

(** Exact provider-owned measurement of one fully prepared completion request.

    The caller supplies the immutable {!Llm_transport.completion_request} that
    reached its transport boundary, after Agent turn hooks, tool projection,
    and caller-owned message projection. The input count uses the provider's
    native count endpoint. The output receipt is resolved from the same config.

    This is a lower-level transport-adapter primitive. Application callers
    must not reconstruct a completion request to call it: final Agent-level
    fit admission must measure the same opaque prepared request that it later
    dispatches. This function neither dispatches nor returns that artifact, so
    its receipt alone does not prove a later dispatch reused the measured
    request value.

    Unsupported provider protocols fail before I/O. No character estimate,
    context-window fallback, fit policy, retry, or truncation is performed. *)
