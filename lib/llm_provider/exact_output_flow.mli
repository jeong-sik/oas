(** Private affine executor for an ordered exact-output flow.

(** Execute one immutable, nonempty candidate snapshot in its declared order.

    Each candidate is passed to [execute] at most once. A successful transport
    result is passed exactly once to the pure [validate] callback. [Accept]
    terminates the flow; [Reject_and_advance] records opaque evidence and moves
    directly to the predetermined successor without invoking [before_advance].
    [before_advance] remains reserved for OAS-classified execution failures.

    The outer attempt is affine. A duplicate or concurrent invocation returns
    [Attempt_already_started]. Any exception, including Eio cancellation,
    terminalizes the outer attempt before the exception is re-raised. *)
