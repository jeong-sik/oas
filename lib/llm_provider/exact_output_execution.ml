      (* This function returns a result, so a transport exception must not leave it.
         classify_network_exn deliberately answers [None] for an exception carrying
         only prose — cohttp-eio raises [Failure "connection closed by peer"] at
         client.ml:60 for a peer close — and post_sync_once's [fail_exn] then
         re-raises it. Refusing to infer a network kind from a message is right; the
         missing half was a boundary that turns the unclassified exception into a
         typed failure. Reserved exceptions (cancellation) are re-raised first, the
         same idiom as complete_common.ml:172 and five other edges.

         [Unknown_provider_failure] is the honest kind: it states that the failure was
         not classified rather than guessing one, and the message travels as
         diagnostics only — http_client.mli:206-207 says consumers branch on the kind
         and never parse the string. Dispatch_started is a floor, not a claim: the
         public receipt is advanced separately by the phase observer and
         Generation_receipt.advance only moves forward, so an already-observed
         Response_received is not lowered by it. *)
