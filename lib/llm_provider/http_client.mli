(** Like {!post_stream} but manages connection lifetime internally.
    [f] receives the reader; when [f] returns the connection is closed

    When [cache] is supplied, the streaming connection is bound to the
    cache's long-lived switch and is parked back after [f] returns, so
    it can be reused across requests. [f] must consume the full response
    body; leaving unread bytes on the reader will corrupt the next reuse.

    initial response headers phase and requires [clock]. Supplying the

    Body consumption in [f] runs OUTSIDE [catch_network]. A body-phase
    [Eio.Time.Timeout] (first-token / prefill wait, inter-chunk idle)
    is therefore NOT mapped to [Http_operation] here. Stream-state-aware
    callers (see {!Complete_stream.body_logic}) catch it inside [f] and

    [Stream_idle]); callers that let it propagate get
    [TimeoutError { phase = Unknown_timeout; _ }] as a safe default. *)

(** Read SSE-formatted lines from a reader.

    Field lines are parsed per the W3C EventSource grammar
    ("name[:[ ]value]" — at most one leading space stripped from the
    value), so both [data: x] and [data:x] dispatch. [event:] sets the
    current event type; [data:] payloads (including empty ones) go to
    [on_data]; [id]/[retry] and unknown field names are ignored; a
    blank line resets the event type. Returns normally on
    [End_of_file].

    [on_data] runs OUTSIDE the idle-timeout window: it must not block —
    a parked handler silences the idle deadline for the whole stream.

    When both [clock] and [idle_timeout] are supplied, raises
    [Eio.Time.Timeout] if no line arrives within [idle_timeout]
    seconds. The deadline resets after each successful meaningful
    line, so this bounds inter-event idle — not total stream
    duration. SSE keepalive comments (lines starting with [:]) are
    skipped inside the same timeout window — they do NOT reset the
    deadline, so a stream of pure keepalives still trips
    [idle_timeout]. Supplying [idle_timeout] WITHOUT [clock] raises
    [Invalid_argument]: that combination used to silently disarm the
    deadline. Wrapped by {!with_post_stream} the timeout should be
    caught by the caller and surfaced as
    [TimeoutError { phase = Stream_idle state; _ }] so downstream
    policy can see which stream state stalled.

    RFC-OAS-037: [first_event_timeout], when supplied (with [clock]),
    bounds the wait for the FIRST meaningful line — the time-to-first-event
    (TTFT / prefill) window — separately from [idle_timeout], which arms
    only AFTER the first meaningful line for inter-token idle. A silent
    prefill on a large context is slow-but-alive, not a hang, so it must not
    be cut by the short [idle_timeout] value. A "meaningful line" here is a
    genuine data/event field: a bare blank dispatch delimiter does NOT end the
    first-event wait (it would switch to the short idle budget prematurely).
    The effective bound is resolved from caller-supplied values only, in the
    order [first_event_timeout] > [body_timeout] (the caller's total body
    budget) > [idle_timeout] (the pre-RFC bound, kept so callers that wired
    only an idle deadline keep their previous behaviour). With none of the
    three supplied the first-event wait stays unarmed, exactly as before this
    change: this function never invents a deadline of its own. Inter-token
    idle still guards once the stream produces. Supplying
    [first_event_timeout] or [body_timeout] WITHOUT [clock] raises
    [Invalid_argument] (same silent-disarm guard as [idle_timeout]). *)

    [Eio.Time.Timeout] if no line arrives within [idle_timeout]

    disarm removed). The raised timeout should be caught by the caller
    and surfaced as [TimeoutError { phase = Stream_idle state; _ }] so

    first-event wait. Omitting [first_event_timeout] falls back to

(** Inject [{"stream_options": {"include_usage": true}}] into a JSON body
    string. OpenAI-compatible providers omit token usage from streaming
    responses unless this flag is set. Use only for OpenAI-compatible
    kinds; native-usage providers (Anthropic, Ollama, Gemini) must not
    receive it. Any caller-supplied [stream_options] is replaced to avoid
    double-injection; a non-object or unparseable body is returned
    unchanged. *)
val inject_stream_options_include_usage : string -> string

(** Inject both ["stream": true] and [{"stream_options": {"include_usage": true}}]
    in a single parse/serialize pass. Byte-identical to
    [inject_stream_param body |> inject_stream_options_include_usage] (proven by
    a parity test), but parses and serializes the body once instead of twice.
    For the OpenAI-compatible streaming path that needs both fields (GLM, Kimi,
    DashScope, OpenAI_compat) this removes one full Yojson parse and one full
    [Yojson.Safe.to_string] of the request body per turn. Native-usage
    providers (Anthropic, Ollama, Gemini) should keep using
    [inject_stream_param] (stream only). *)
