(** Canonical tool projections (RFC-OAS-024, WP8 — Increments 1-2).

    Typed read-projections of the tool-call/tool-result dimensions of
    {!Types.content_block}. These are {b not} a second in-memory SSOT:
    [content_block] remains the canonical representation and every value here is
    derived from it at the provider boundary.

    Scope (RFC-OAS-024 §7): Increment 1 shipped [tool_result_of_block].
    Increment 2 adds [provider_tool_call] and [tool_calls_of_response] as a
    structural projection for downstream renderers/executors. Reasoning metadata
    is only linked when it is immediately adjacent in the canonical content
    order; this module never infers semantic ownership across Text/media/result
    boundaries and never exposes raw provider reasoning payloads.

    Boundary (RFC-OAS-024 §1): OAS-owned provider canonicalization only. Depends
    solely on provider-boundary types and references no execution, policy, or
    coordinator concept. The downstream consumer is named only as an unnamed
    external role.
