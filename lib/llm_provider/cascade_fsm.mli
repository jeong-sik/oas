(** Cascade FSM — pure decision logic for multi-provider failover.

    Separates the cascade decision tree from IO (HTTP calls, throttle,
    timeout). The executor feeds provider outcomes to [decide], which
    returns the next action without side effects.

    This module owns the "what to do next" logic. The executor owns
    the "how to do it" (network, slots, diagnostics).
