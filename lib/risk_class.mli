(** Risk classification for contract-driven agent runs.

    Part of the Contract-Driven Agent Loop (CDAL) PoC-1.
    Three-axis model: blast_radius x irreversibility x recovery_cost. *)

type t =
  | Low       (** Small radius, easy rollback, low recovery cost *)
  | Medium    (** One or more ambiguous/mid-level axes *)
  | High      (** Any one axis large; Execute forbidden without human review *)
  | Critical  (** Hard to reverse or external system damage; default = reject *)

(** Maximum allowed execution mode for this risk class.
    [None] means the run should be rejected outright. *)
