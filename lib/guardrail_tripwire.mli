(** Tripwire guardrails: fail-fast parallel validators.

    A tripwire runs concurrently with the main agent LLM call.
    If any tripwire fires before the action completes, the action's
    fiber is cancelled via Eio structured concurrency.

    Uses [Eio.Fiber.first] (not [both]) so the first completion
    cancels the other fiber.

(** {1 Execution} *)

(** Run the action and all tripwires concurrently.
    If any tripwire fires (returns [Error]) before the action completes,
    the action fiber is cancelled and [Error (`Tripped ...)] is returned.
    If the action completes first, tripwire fibers are cancelled.

    With zero tripwires, runs the action directly (no fiber overhead). *)
