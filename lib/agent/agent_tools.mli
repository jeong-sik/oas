(** {1 Tool scheduling and execution} *)

(** Execute tool-use content blocks using the declared execution mode.

    Non-[ToolUse] blocks in the input list are filtered out before
    execution — only [ToolUse] blocks produce result triples.

    Scheduling is deterministic:
    - [Tool_contract.Concurrent] calls in the same contiguous batch may overlap.
    - [Tool_contract.Serial] calls run one-at-a-time in input order and separate
      concurrent batches.
    - Tools without a declared descriptor default to [Tool_contract.Serial].

    For each [ToolUse] block, applies the [PreToolUse] hook before execution.
    [ElicitToolApproval] is settled synchronously through the caller-owned
    [tool_approval] callback before any invocation is opened. Only
    [Hooks.Approved] admits the exact call; [Denied] and [Timed_out] return
    deterministic blocked tool results. Generic [ElicitInput]/[Answer] never
    grants execution authority. A missing approval callback fails closed as
    [Hook_failure].

    An ordinary tool-handler exception is localized to that call as a
    non-retryable tool result. A terminal tool-handler exception propagates
    with its original backtrace because no typed pre-effect proof exists and a
    second provider turn would be unsafe. Typed hook failures and ordinary
    observer failures are returned as values after the current concurrent batch
    has joined, so they do not cancel sibling tool handlers. [Out_of_memory],
    [Stack_overflow], [Sys.Break], and cancellation still propagate through the
    surrounding Eio scope.

    [on_tool_execution_started] and [on_tool_execution_finished] are
    caller-owned lifecycle observers. Their failures, event-bus publication
    failures, journal projection failures, and tracer failures propagate to the
    caller through [Observer_failure]; OAS never hides an observer failure.

    [Block] produces a model-visible deterministic result without emitting
    tool-execution lifecycle callbacks or durable events, because no tool ran.

    When an Agent-owned execution provider is bound internally, its recursive execution journal is
    the sole tool-effect authority: OAS durably opens the exact invocation and
    commits an attempt before the handler, atomically settles the exact result,
    and replays a settled result without rerunning observers or the handler.
    Legacy [journal] Tool_called/Tool_completed projections are suppressed on
    this path. A durability failure dominates hook and observer failures because
    effect-outcome truth must not be hidden.

    On success, returns one [tool_execution_result] per [ToolUse] block in the
    same relative order as the input. On failure, [completed_results] retains
    every completed result in that order alongside the terminal cause. Serial
    work after a failure is not started; already-running concurrent siblings
    finish under their declared structured-concurrency batch. *)
