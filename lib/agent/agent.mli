(** [checkpoint_sink] attaches an optional caller-owned mutation-boundary
    checkpoint sink. The pipeline updates live state first, then emits a typed
    snapshot after assistant collection, after base tool-result append, and
    after successful context injection. A sink failure is returned before the
    pipeline advances to the next mutation stage. The sink is passed here
    rather than through {!options} so callers that construct options records
    remain source-compatible.

    [provider_config] is the exact typed provider carrier. When supplied it
    replaces [options.provider]; endpoint, credential, request path, headers,
    and capability overrides are not reconstructed from the legacy option.

    [context_fit_admission], [model_input_projection], and
    [pre_dispatch_serialization_observer] are separate from [options] so callers
    that construct options records remain source-compatible.
    The optional projection is applied once during turn preparation; native
    request measurement and provider dispatch consume the same projected
    messages. A returned [Error detail] or non-reserved callback exception
    fails the turn as {!Error.HookExecutionFailed}.

    [pre_dispatch_serialization_observer] receives metadata-only evidence for
    the admitted provider body before built-in HTTP dispatch is attempted. It
    does not prove that transport dispatch started or completed. *)

(** Configure one durable execution scope. Without [resume], the directory must

    reopens that scope in the same directory, validates Agent identity and the
    restored user input, and replays settled ToolResults without rerunning tool
    gates, handlers, or completion observers. An admitted Tool attempt without
    a settled result fails closed because its external outcome is unknown.

    The same optional value is accepted by regular, streaming, handoff,
    single-turn, and [Advanced] run entry points; no parallel durable run
    surface is introduced. One store and directory must be used for exactly one
    API call. A cooperative [Yielded] return is a successful terminal boundary
    for that call.

    [on_scope_ready], when supplied, must persist the opaque locator before
    provider or Tool effects begin. It is invoked for both fresh and resumed
    scopes, so the sink should be idempotent. Failure aborts the scope and the
    Agent call. The same locator and directory can be passed to
    {!open_execution_projection} immediately for live reads or later after a
    restart; the callback is not a separate event or catch-up authority.

    [on_terminal_disposition] is invoked after the terminal journal commit and
    successful writer drain, before this Agent call returns. [Retire] means the
    caller-owned recovery locator may be removed.
    [Operator_repair_required Effect_outcome_unknown] means an admitted Tool
    attempt has no settled result, so automatic retry could duplicate an
    external effect. The sink should persist the decision idempotently. A
    returned error or non-reserved exception fails the Agent call with
    [Error.Internal] after the terminal commit; the recovery locator must
    remain. If writer drain fails, the sink is not invoked and the locator must
    likewise remain. Caller cancellation is protected through terminal
    settlement, writer drain, and callback, then re-raised. If callback cleanup
    also fails, cancellation remains the primary exception and the cleanup
    failure is logged. *)

      The callback is evaluated only after all tool executions for the turn,
      optional context injection, and the final configured checkpoint-sink
      call have succeeded.  [checkpoint_stage] identifies that typed boundary.
      When no checkpoint sink is configured, crossing the stage is an in-memory
      boundary and does not claim durable persistence.

      The callback runs synchronously on the agent fiber and should only inspect
      host state and return a decision; blocking work belongs after a [Yielded]
      return.

      [on_yield] and [on_resume] preserve the regular run API's provider-lease

      injection, and the final checkpoint sink. [Continue] invokes [on_resume]
      before the next provider turn; [Yield] returns with the lease released
      and does not invoke [on_resume] in this call.

      [Yielded] is a successful host outcome: it is not an SDK error, does not
      consume or enforce a turn/time/cost budget, and leaves the agent lifecycle
      [Ready].  Its [checkpoint] is captured only after the callback chooses

(** Run the agent until a provider returns a terminal response or a typed error.
    The tool loop is unbounded: OAS does not stop it because of turn count,
    idle-turn count, tool-round count, accumulated cost, or token usage. Those
    values are observations only.

    The caller owns the lifetime of the run through Eio structured
    concurrency. Use a caller-owned child switch or cancellation scope to stop
    one run without cancelling unrelated lanes, and wrap that scope in an
    objective deadline when a whole-run timeout is required. Supplying [clock]
    does not create such a deadline; it supplies time to periodic callbacks and
    to explicitly configured provider body or stream-idle timeouts.
    Caller-initiated [Eio.Cancel.Cancelled] propagates and is not converted into
    an agent result.

    [on_yield] is called after a non-empty tool batch and the collected
    assistant checkpoint have been validated, immediately before the first
