(** Private durable-execution ownership for one pipeline turn. *)

type t

(** A [Closed Succeeded] turn found at the resume frontier under a still-[Running]
    run: an idempotent completed boundary left by a crash between the provider
    close, the turn close, and the root finish. Opaque to the driver, which only
    threads it back through {!finalize_settled}. *)
type settled_boundary

(** Total classification of what a resume found at the durable turn frontier.
    [Fresh] runs a new turn; [Active] resumes an in-progress turn/provider;
    [Settled] surfaces an already-settled turn boundary (see {!finalize_settled}). *)
