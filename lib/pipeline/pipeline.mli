(** Turn pipeline: 6-stage decomposition of agent turn execution.

    [Input] -> [Parse] -> [Route] -> [Collect] -> [Output]
    (Execute runs inside Output on StopToolUse.)

    Each stage is a well-defined function.  The pipeline coordinates
    them, threading agent state through mutable updates.  This module
    replaces the monolithic [run_turn_core] in agent.ml.

    Equivalent to the previous [run_turn_core].

    [before_tool_execution], when present, runs exactly once for a non-empty
    tool batch after assistant collection has committed successfully and before
    the first tool hook or implementation starts.  Exceptions propagate and
    prevent tool execution.

    A private fiber-local execution scope, when bound by [Agent], owns the turn
    and exact selected provider attempt before provider I/O. The caller owns
    root settlement; this function closes its successful turn descendants,
    while an error leaves them open for the caller's atomic abort. *)
