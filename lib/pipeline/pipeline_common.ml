(** Turn pipeline: 6-stage decomposition of agent turn execution.

    Replaces the monolithic run_turn_core with named stages:
    1. Input   — lifecycle, BeforeTurn hook, elicitation
    2. Parse   — BeforeTurnParams hook, context reduction, tool preparation
    3. Route   — provider selection, API call dispatch (sync/stream)
    4. Collect — usage accumulation, AfterTurn hook, events, message append
    5. Execute — exact-name tool execution on StopToolUse
    6. Output  — stop reason → turn_outcome *)
