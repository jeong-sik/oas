(** Lane-local single-writer actor for the recursive execution journal.

    Construction returns before filesystem initialization finishes. Semantic
    mutations are accepted as typed journal transactions, committed by the
    actor, and acknowledged only after the journal authority is durable.

    This module is private to OAS. It owns no product policy and exposes no
    storage primitive or raw-event append path. *)

(** Run a fresh durability scope inside an OAS-owned supervisor. The callback
    may fork work on [sw]. When it returns normally, the wrapper stops
    admission, drains every accepted command, joins the actor, and only then
    returns its value. A callback exception also stops admission and lets the
    actor finish or reconcile every actor-owned durability operation before the
    original exception is re-raised; the supervisor fiber never settles an
    in-flight durability group itself. *)
