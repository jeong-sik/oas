(** Summary statistics for a sample. *)
type stats = {
  n: int;
  mean: float;
  std_dev: float;
  min_val: float;
  max_val: float;
}

(** Compute summary statistics for a list of floats.
    Returns [None] for empty lists. *)
val summary_stats : float list -> stats option

(** Compute a confidence interval using the normal approximation.
    Returns [(lower, upper)] bounds.
    [confidence] should be between 0 and 1 (e.g. 0.95 for 95% CI).
    Returns [None] if sample size < 2. *)
val confidence_interval : float list -> confidence:float -> (float * float) option

(** Detect regression using Welch's t-test.
    Returns [true] if the current sample is significantly worse
    (higher values) than baseline at the 0.05 significance level.
    Returns [false] if either sample has fewer than 2 elements. *)
val is_regression : baseline:float list -> current:float list -> bool

(** Compute Cohen's d effect size between two samples.
    Returns [None] if either sample has fewer than 2 elements or pooled std_dev is 0. *)
val effect_size : float list -> float list -> float option

(** Direction of a sliding-window trend. *)
type trend = Improving | Degrading | Stable | Insufficient_data

(** Detect trend direction over the last [window] data points using linear regression.
    Returns [Insufficient_data] if the list has fewer than [window] elements. *)
val detect_trend : window:int -> float list -> trend

(** Count consecutive transitions in the same direction from the end of a list.
    Returns [(count, direction)]. An empty or single-element list returns [(0, `Flat)]. *)
val consecutive_direction : float list -> int * [`Up | `Down | `Flat]
