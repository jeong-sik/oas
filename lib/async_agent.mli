(** Async Agent — Eio fiber-based background agent execution.

    Provides [future]-based spawning, race, and fan-out patterns
    for running agents concurrently without blocking the caller.

    All operations require an Eio switch for structured concurrency.
    Cancellation is best-effort: once the spawned fiber installs its
    sub-switch, [cancel] fails that switch to interrupt in-flight I/O
    and also resolves the future as cancelled.

type 'a future

(** {1 Spawning} *)

(** [spawn ~sw ?clock agent prompt] launches [agent] in a background
    Eio fiber and returns a future immediately.

    The agent runs within [sw]'s scope; if [sw] is cancelled, the
    fiber is cancelled too (Eio structured concurrency guarantee). *)
val spawn :
  sw:Eio.Switch.t ->

  Types.api_response future

(** {1 Awaiting} *)

(** [await future] blocks the calling fiber until the background
    agent completes (or is cancelled). *)
val await : 'a future -> ('a, Error.sdk_error) result

(** [is_ready future] returns [true] if the result is already available. *)
val is_ready : 'a future -> bool

(** {1 Cancellation} *)

(** [cancel future] marks the future as cancelled immediately and, if the
    spawned fiber has already installed its sub-switch, fails that switch
    so in-flight I/O can be interrupted.

    This makes cancellation idempotent and visible to callers right away,
    while still propagating the cancellation signal into the running fiber
    when possible. *)
val cancel : 'a future -> unit

(** {1 Combinators} *)

(** [race ~sw ?clock agents] runs all [(agent, prompt)] pairs concurrently
    and returns the result of the first agent to finish. Remaining agents
    are cancelled via Eio structured concurrency.

    Returns [(agent_name, response)] on success, where [agent_name]
    is derived from the agent's card. *)

(** [all ~sw ?clock ?max_fibers agents] runs all [(agent, prompt)] pairs
    and waits for all to complete. Returns a list of
    [(agent_name, result)] pairs in the same order as input.

    @param max_fibers limits concurrent fibers (default: no limit). *)
