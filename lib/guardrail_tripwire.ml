(** Tripwire guardrails: fail-fast parallel validators.

    Uses [Eio.Fiber.first] for cancel-on-first-completion semantics.
    When the tripwire fiber finishes (violation found), the action fiber
    is cancelled. When the action finishes first, tripwires are cancelled.

    If all pass, blocks forever (Promise.await) so the action fiber can win.
