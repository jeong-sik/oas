## Code style

### .mli-first development

Public API changes start in `lib/agent_sdk.mli`. The .mli file is the contract.
Implementation follows the interface, not the other way around.

```
1. Edit lib/agent_sdk.mli   (define the interface)
2. Edit lib/<module>.ml      (implement it)
3. Edit test/test_<module>.ml (prove it works)
4. dune runtest               (verify)
```

### Naming conventions

| Item | Convention | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Module | PascalCase | `Direct_evidence` |
| Type | snake_case | `agent_state` |
| Function | snake_case | `create_message_stream` |
| Variant | PascalCase | `EndTurn`, `StopToolUse` |

### Type safety

- Prefer `result` types over exceptions for expected failures.
- Use inline records for variants with 3+ fields (not positional tuples).
- Avoid `Obj.magic`. If the type system fights you, the design needs to change.
- `option` over sentinel values. `None` over empty string.

## Pull request expectations

1. **Tests required**: Every behavior change needs a test. `dune runtest` must pass.
2. **Interface first**: If you change public API, update `agent_sdk.mli` first.
3. **CHANGELOG**: Add an entry under `## [Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md`.
4. **One concern per PR**: Keep PRs focused. Split unrelated changes.

## Pinned fork dependencies

Two dependencies are pinned to forks. Both are temporary.

| Package | Fork | Why | Upstream status |
|---------|------|-----|-----------------|
| `bisect_ppx` | `patricoferris/bisect_ppx#5.2` | Upstream 2.8.x fails on OCaml 5.4. This fork adds 5.4 compat. | PR pending upstream. Remove pin when bisect_ppx >= 2.9 ships. |
| `mcp_protocol` | `jeong-sik/mcp-protocol-sdk` at the SHA from `scripts/mcp-sdk-pin.sh` | OCaml MCP bindings are pinned to the CI SSOT so local and CI installs stay identical. | Move to opam package releases when installation no longer depends on a git pin. |

These pins are set in CI (`ci.yml`) and in the build instructions above.
When upstream releases resolve the issue, remove the pin and use the opam version.

## Versioning policy

We follow semver intent within the 0.x series:

- **0.x.0**: May contain breaking changes. Migration guide in CHANGELOG.
- **0.x.y** (y > 0): Additive features and bug fixes only.
- Target cadence: at most one minor release per week.

Version sources (must always match, enforced by CI):

| Source | Location |
|--------|----------|
| `dune-project` | `(version X.Y.Z)` |
| `lib/agent_sdk.ml` | `let version = "X.Y.Z"` |

### Release process

```bash
# 1. Verify version consistency (dry run)
./scripts/release.sh

# 2. Create and push tag
./scripts/release.sh --tag
```

The release script checks: version consistency, CHANGELOG entry exists,
tag doesn't already exist, clean working tree.

## Module stability tiers

Not all modules are equally stable. See README.md for the current tier list.

- **Stable**: Safe to depend on. Breaking changes get a minor version bump.
- **Evolving**: API may change between minor versions. Use with awareness.
- **Experimental**: May be removed or redesigned. Not recommended for production use.
