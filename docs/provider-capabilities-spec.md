# Provider Capabilities Specification

Defines what an agent SDK needs to know about an LLM provider/model
to make correct runtime decisions.

Historical baseline from the March 2026 capability survey. Structured
output notes in this document were revalidated against official provider
docs and the current OAS serializers on 2026-04-21.

## Historical Baseline (v0.71.0)

```ocaml
type capabilities = {
  supports_tools: bool;
  supports_tool_choice: bool;
  supports_reasoning: bool;
  supports_response_format_json: bool;
  supports_multimodal_inputs: bool;
  supports_native_streaming: bool;
  supports_top_k: bool;
  supports_min_p: bool;
}
```

8 boolean fields. No numeric limits. `supports_reasoning` conflates
4 distinct mechanisms. `supports_multimodal_inputs` conflates 3 modalities.

Current OAS code has already added many of the proposed fields in
`lib/llm_provider/capabilities.ml`. This document is still useful as a
design note, but the structured output section below is the authoritative
reference for the difference between official provider support and current
OAS wiring.

## Proposed: 3-Tier Capability Model

### Tier 1: Limits (numeric, agent crashes without these)

| Field | Type | Why |
|-------|------|-----|
| `max_context_tokens` | `int option` | context_reducer needs a ceiling. Range: 128K-10M across models. None = unknown. |
| `max_output_tokens` | `int option` | agent_config.max_tokens must not exceed this. Range: 8K-128K. Silent truncation if exceeded. |

Discovery fills these for local models (`ctx_size` from `/props`).
Cloud providers need hardcoded lookup tables keyed by model_id.

### Tier 2: Feature flags (boolean, affects agent behavior)

| Field | Current | Change | Rationale |
|-------|---------|--------|-----------|
| `supports_tools` | exists | keep | |
| `supports_tool_choice` | exists | keep | |
| `supports_parallel_tool_calls` | missing | add | DeepSeek R1 has no tool calling at all. Cohere supports it. OAS has `disable_parallel_tool_use` but no capability check. |
| `supports_system_prompt` | missing | add | Most models support it, but some fine-tuned/distilled variants do not. Agent must fold system into first user message. |
| `supports_reasoning` | exists | **split into 4** | See Thinking Taxonomy below. |
| `supports_extended_thinking` | missing | add | budget_tokens control. Claude, Gemini, GPT-5.4. |
| `supports_think_tool` | missing | add | Anthropic-only. Mid-reasoning pause between tool calls. |
| `supports_adaptive_reasoning` | missing | add | Model auto-selects depth. Opus 4.6, Gemini 3 dynamic. |
| `supports_reasoning_budget` | missing | add | budget_tokens (Anthropic), reasoning_effort (OpenAI), thinking_level (Gemini). |
| `supports_structured_output` | exists in code | keep, tighten semantics | Use only for provider-native schema-constrained output APIs. Do not use it for JSON mode or "prompt with schema text + app-side validator" patterns. |
| `supports_response_format_json` | exists in code | keep, separate from schema guarantee | JSON mode means "return valid JSON" only. It is not a subset of native schema support and still requires caller-side shape validation. |
| `supports_caching` | missing | add | Prompt caching: Anthropic (90% savings), OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek. |
| `supports_computer_use` | missing | add | Claude, GPT-5.4 native. New tool category. |
| `supports_code_execution` | missing | add | Gemini built-in, OpenAI code_interpreter. Server-side sandbox. |
| `supports_native_streaming` | exists | keep | |
| `supports_multimodal_inputs` | exists | **split into 3** | See Multimodal Taxonomy below. |
| `supports_image_input` | missing | add | Most models except DeepSeek, Cohere. |
| `supports_audio_input` | missing | add | Gemini only (native audio tokens). |
| `supports_video_input` | missing | add | Gemini, Qwen 3.5 large. |
| `supports_top_k` | exists | keep | |
| `supports_min_p` | exists | keep | |

### Tier 3: Protocol (how to talk to the provider)

Already covered by `request_kind` and `Provider.provider` types.
Consider adding:

| Field | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|
| `Openai_responses` request_kind | OpenAI Responses API: server-side state, built-in tools, remote MCP. Distinct from chat completions. |
| `supports_remote_mcp` | OpenAI Responses API passes MCP servers as API parameters. |

## Structured Output Semantics (updated 2026-04-21)

Use two layers when discussing structured output support:

- Official provider capability: what the provider's documented API can do.
- Current OAS wiring: what the current serializer path actually sends on
  the wire today.

Semantic contract:

- `supports_response_format_json` — the provider can be asked to return
  syntactically valid JSON. The caller must still validate the shape.
- `supports_structured_output` — the provider exposes a native request
  field for schema-constrained output, so the schema is enforced by the
  provider rather than only by prompt instructions or app-side retries.

The two flags are related but not interchangeable:

- OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, and Ollama officially support both JSON mode
  and native schema-constrained output.
- GLM's current official docs describe JSON mode via
  `response_format = {"type":"json_object"}` plus prompt/schema guidance,
  but do not document a separate native JSON-schema request field.
- Generic OpenAI-compatible servers must be treated as host-specific. Do
  not infer native schema support from wire compatibility alone.

### Structured Output: Official Support vs Current OAS Wiring

| Provider | Official API surface | Guarantee level | Current OAS wiring | Note / risk |
|----------|----------------------|-----------------|--------------------|-------------|
| OpenAI | `response_format: {type: "json_schema", ...}` plus JSON mode `json_object` | Native schema guarantee + JSON mode | `backend_openai.ml` emits `json_schema` for `JsonSchema _` and `json_object` for `JsonMode` | OAS only accepts native schema for official OpenAI hosts after `Provider_config.validate_output_schema_request`. |
| Gemini | `generationConfig.responseMimeType = "application/json"` plus `responseJsonSchema` / `responseSchema` | Native schema guarantee + JSON mode | `backend_gemini.ml` emits `responseMimeType` plus `responseJsonSchema` for `JsonSchema _`; `JsonMode` keeps `responseMimeType` only | OAS uses `responseJsonSchema`; other documented field names remain provider aliases. |
| Anthropic | `output_config.format` for JSON outputs; strict tool use is separate | Native schema guarantee for JSON outputs; strict tool use validates tool names and inputs, not assistant text shape | `backend_anthropic.ml` emits `output_config.format`; `lib/structured.ml` direct extraction uses native schema output | Strict tool use remains separate; do not describe Anthropic structured output as "tool-use only". |
| Ollama | `/api/chat` `format` accepts `"json"` or a JSON schema | JSON mode or native schema guarantee, depending on `format` | `backend_ollama.ml` emits `/api/chat format` as `"json"` or a JSON schema | Native schema still depends on the target Ollama server honoring `format`. |
| GLM | `response_format = {"type":"json_object"}` plus prompt/schema-in-text guidance | JSON mode only in the current official docs | OAS keeps GLM on the OpenAI-style `json_object` path and rejects `output_schema` up front | Keep caller-side validation; do not treat this as provider-native schema enforcement. |
| Generic OpenAI-compatible / llama.cpp | Varies by server, release, and host integration | Host-specific; do not assume schema support | OAS rejects native schema by default for generic OpenAI-compatible hosts; only official OpenAI hosts pass validation today | OpenAI-compatible wire shape is not enough evidence for native schema support. |

## Thinking Taxonomy

`supports_reasoning: bool` is insufficient. 2025-2026 models have 4 distinct mechanisms:

| Mechanism | When | Control | Models |
|-----------|------|---------|--------|
| Extended thinking | Before response | `budget_tokens` | Claude, Gemini, GPT-5.4 |
| Think tool | Between tool calls | Declared as tool | Claude only |
| Adaptive reasoning | Automatic | None (model decides) | Opus 4.6, Gemini 3 |
| Interleaved thinking | Mixed with tool calls | Beta header | Claude only |

Proposal: keep `supports_reasoning` as the union (any of the above),
add specific flags for SDK features that depend on the distinction.

Minimum viable split:
- `supports_extended_thinking` — enables `thinking_budget` in agent config
- `supports_reasoning_budget` — enables cost-aware thinking control

## Multimodal Taxonomy

`supports_multimodal_inputs: bool` conflates 3 modalities with different
availability:

| Modality | Models |
|----------|--------|
| Image | Claude, GPT, Gemini, Qwen 3.5 large, Llama 4, Mistral, Grok |
| Audio | Gemini only (native tokens) |
| Video | Gemini, Qwen 3.5 large only |

Minimum viable split: `supports_image_input`, keep `supports_multimodal_inputs`
as the union. Audio/video can be added later.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Numeric limits + critical booleans
- Add `max_context_tokens`, `max_output_tokens` to capabilities
- Add `supports_parallel_tool_calls`, `supports_system_prompt`
- Add lookup table for known models (keyed by model_id prefix)
- Wire Discovery.ctx_size into capabilities

### Phase 2: Thinking split + structured output
- Split `supports_reasoning` → keep as union + add `supports_extended_thinking`
- Keep `supports_structured_output` and `supports_response_format_json` as distinct contracts
- Wire native schema request paths only where the official provider API exposes them
- Keep JSON mode + caller-side validation for providers whose current official docs stop at `json_object`
- Add `supports_caching`
- Add `supports_reasoning_budget`

### Phase 3: New modalities
- Add `supports_computer_use`, `supports_code_execution`
- Split multimodal → `supports_image_input` (keep union)

### Phase 4: Protocol evolution
- Add `Openai_responses` request_kind
- Add `supports_remote_mcp`
