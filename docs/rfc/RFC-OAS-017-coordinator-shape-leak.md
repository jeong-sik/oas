## Summary

This RFC tracked accidental coordinator-shaped SDK surface area. The current
SDK keeps runtime protocol and proof surfaces generic and removes the old
domain-specific projection/schema layer from OAS.

## Current State

- The historical standalone domain module is gone.
- The public runtime protocol no longer exports the old projection event family.
- Runtime output schema catalogs no longer list the removed projection schema.
- Downstream product domains must publish their own domain events instead of
  using OAS as a shared-state or UI-event substrate.

## Acceptance

The RFC is complete when `lib/`, `test/`, `README.md`, and live schema catalogs
do not expose the retired domain projection API. Historical audit artifacts may
still explain why earlier surfaces were removed.
