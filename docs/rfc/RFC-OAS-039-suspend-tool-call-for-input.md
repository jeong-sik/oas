## 0. Summary

`Pre_tool_use` is the first hook stage that knows the exact tool occurrence and
input. This RFC admits `ElicitToolApproval` at that stage and settles it
through the separate caller-configured `options.tool_approval` callback before
the tool invocation is opened.

- Only the closed `Approved` result authorizes the exact call.
- `Denied` and `Timed_out` produce a typed non-retryable `ToolResult` without
  executing the tool.
- A missing callback fails closed as `Hook_execution_failed`; no invocation or
  effect is started.

The before-turn `Agent.provide_input` API is intentionally not reused. It
appends a `User` message and has different transcript semantics.

## 1. Problem

Before this change, the hook decision matrix accepted `ElicitInput` only at
`Before_turn`. A caller that needs approval for one exact tool call could not
ask after the provider had selected both the tool and its input.

Encoding a pending decision as a successful tool result is incorrect:
`tool_result_outcome` has only `Tool_succeeded` and `Tool_failed`, and provider
wire formats require every emitted result to describe a completed call.

## 2. Decision

The legal decisions are:

```ocaml
| Before_turn  -> [ K_Continue; K_ElicitInput; K_Nudge ]
| Pre_tool_use -> [ K_Continue; K_Block; K_ElicitToolApproval ]
```

When a `Pre_tool_use` hook returns `ElicitToolApproval prompt`,
`Agent_tools.execute_tools` creates an immutable request containing that prompt,
the exact invocation, tool name, and input, then consults the configured typed
callback:

```ocaml
match options.tool_approval exact_request with
| Approved -> execute_the_exact_call ()
| Denied -> blocked_tool_result "Tool execution was denied by the caller"
| Timed_out -> blocked_tool_result "Tool execution approval timed out"
```

Generic `Answer of Yojson.Safe.t` and a JSON Schema are deliberately absent from
this boundary. They express user input, not execution authority; accepting a
schema-shaped JSON value would reintroduce an untyped approval protocol. A
generic `ElicitInput` returned at `Pre_tool_use` is stage-illegal and fails
closed before its callback or any effect runs. The approval result is not
appended as a `User` message. A refusal is represented as the same
model-visible, deterministic failure shape used by `Hooks.Block`, and no tool
lifecycle event is emitted for an effect that never started.

## 3. Fail-closed boundary

An asynchronous durable suspension is not implemented by this RFC.

Opening an invocation and returning `Error.InputRequired` is insufficient:

1. the generic execution runner closes ordinary `Error` results as failed;
2. merely finding an open invocation during resume cannot prove that the host
   approved it;
3. concurrent calls can create multiple pending decisions while a single
   request payload exposes only one;
4. checkpointing a sibling result while another call is pending creates a
   partial tool-result set that the durable resume topology correctly rejects.

A future asynchronous API therefore needs a typed journal event for the gate
request and its answer, a stage-specific public response method, atomic refusal
settlement, and an explicit partial-batch recovery contract. Until those types
exist, a missing callback fails before `open_invocation`.

## 4. Public contract

The hook decision matrix in `Hooks`, the README, and the event catalog all list
`ElicitToolApproval` as legal at `Pre_tool_use`.

The configured callback is honored consistently at both legal elicitation
stages, with stage-specific transcript behavior:

- `Before_turn`: an `Answer` may add a user message before provider dispatch.
- `Pre_tool_use`: an `Approved` result authorizes the exact call and adds no
  user message.

## 5. Verification

Focused tests must prove:

1. `ElicitToolApproval` is legal at `Pre_tool_use` and remains illegal at every
   other unsupported stage; generic `ElicitInput` is rejected there.
2. `Approved` executes the exact call once.
3. `Denied` and `Timed_out` execute it zero times and return a typed
   non-retryable failure.
4. Missing callback support fails closed before invocation/effect execution.
5. The public hook matrix and user-facing documentation agree with runtime
   validation.

## 6. Non-goals

- Adding a third provider-wire tool result state.
- Treating `_meta` as a control-flow protocol.
- Reusing before-turn `Agent.provide_input` for tool-gate answers.
- Claiming asynchronous or crash-resumable approval without durable typed
  request/response evidence.
