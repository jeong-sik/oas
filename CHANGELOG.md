Historical note: release notes for `0.100.3`, `0.100.5`, and `0.100.6` were
backfilled on 2026-04-04 from existing git tags. The dates below reflect the
original tag dates. `0.100.4` was never tagged or released.

## Unreleased

## [0.225.0](https://github.com/jeong-sik/oas/compare/v0.224.0...v0.225.0) (2026-07-26)

### Breaking Changes

* **exact-output preference lifecycle:** replace caller-sized raw recovery and
  process-local scope removal with provider-neutral evidence recovery and a
  current-schema durable scope-retirement intent. OAS validates the complete
  evidence set, derives capacity from distinct active scopes, restores
  reservation and success high-water marks, and prevents retired or stale
  settlements from resurrecting a scope. No legacy aliases, historical
  decoder, migration path, or provider/model/pricing policy is included.

### Bug Fixes

* **retry:** classify HTTP 413 as typed `Request_body_refused_by_provider`
  instead of an unknown invalid request, without fabricating measured size
  limits (#2818).

## [0.224.0](https://github.com/jeong-sik/oas/compare/v0.223.2...v0.224.0) (2026-07-26)

### Breaking Changes

* **exact-output durable domain settlement:** replace process-local
  `settle_flow_domain` and its already-settled error with a provider-neutral
  current-schema durable intent, caller commit fence, deterministic idempotent
  receipt, typed nonblocking concurrent-publication outcome, and restart-only
  preference recovery. Recovery restores OAS-owned reservation and
  success-ordinal high-water marks before an active preference store can create
  snapshots. No compatibility wrapper or predecessor decoder is provided.
* **exact-output flow settlement:** require an explicit hard capacity when
  creating a scope-local preference store, add explicit scope removal and typed
  capacity/released-scope failures, and replace caller-provided success
  timestamps with an OAS-owned monotonic ordinal frozen at structural success.
  Domain settlement receipts are now private evidence values, so callers can
  inspect but cannot construct them.
* **tool lifecycle:** replace independently writable tool-call id, turn, and
  schedule copies across hooks, events, results, failures, and execution
  callbacks with one run-scoped `Tool.Invocation.t`. The invocation now owns
  its canonical `Tool.schedule`; `Hooks.tool_schedule` remains a type alias,
  not a second representation. Provider wire messages, SDK errors, and the
  compatible durable journal retain their external shapes and are projected
  from the invocation at those boundaries. Raw-trace tool and hook records add
  occurrence fields while remaining backward-readable. See the
  [0.216 migration guide](docs/migrations/0.216-tool-invocation-ssot.md).
* **agent-as-tool inputs:** remove `Agent_tool.config.input_parameters` and
  scalar-string invocation. The advertised and consumed input contract is now
  exactly one required object field, `prompt`; see the
  [0.213 migration guide](docs/migrations/0.213-agent-tool-input.md).
* **HTTP deadlines:** remove the implicit 60-second request/connect deadline
  and 30-second response-drain deadline. `timeout_s` and
  `connect_timeout_s` are enforced only when explicitly supplied, and a
  deadline without a clock now returns typed `AcceptRejected` instead of
  silently running unarmed.
* **hooks:** remove `Skip`/`K_Skip` and `Override`/`K_Override`. A
  `PreToolUse` hook now either executes the real tool with `Continue`, rejects
  it with `Block`; OAS no longer owns approval orchestration or fabricates a
  successful tool result without executing a tool.
* **hook failures:** make `HookFailed.stage` a closed `Hooks.hook_stage`, remove
  the unvalidated `Hooks.invoke` entry point, and make the internal
  `Agent_tools` execution surface return completed results alongside typed hook
  or observer failures. A failed post-execution hook is an agent error after
  the real tool completion has been observed and checkpointed; it is never
  rewritten as a retryable tool result.
* **durable journal:** `Durable_event.append` now returns an explicit observer
  error carrying the original exception and raw backtrace. The event remains
  committed before callback notification; ordinary callback failures are no
  longer silently discarded, while cancellation and fatal exceptions still
  propagate.
* **hooks:** establish 0.209 as the supported compatibility floor for
  `Hooks.Block` and `K_Block`, which were incorrectly shipped in the 0.208.21
  patch line. Exhaustive matches must handle the new variants; see the
  [hook decision migration guide](docs/migrations/0.209-hook-block.md).
* **context:** remove the public `Agent_sdk.Context_intent` module. Consumers
  must move query-intent classification to their own typed boundary; see the
  [0.209 migration guide](docs/migrations/0.209-context-intent-removal.md).
  The usual deprecation window is waived as a safety exception: restoring the
  removed implementation or a compatibility shim would preserve heuristic
  string matching and a silent model-error fallback.
* **agent:** remove numeric lifecycle ceilings, repeated-call idle heuristics,
  exit predicates, and their errors/hooks. `Agent.run` has no turn, idle-turn,
  tool-round, cost, or token-budget stop gate; those counters remain telemetry.
  Callers own whole-run Eio cancellation/deadlines, while provider body and
  stream-idle deadlines apply only when explicitly configured.
* **runtime:** remove turn ceilings from runtime, session, and subagent
  contracts. Turn counts remain observations and never stop a lane.
* **scheduling:** remove request-priority classes, numeric ranks, implicit
  defaults, and agent/completion priority fields. Provider capacity scheduling
  now grants queued requests in FIFO arrival order; resumed permits rejoin the
  same queue and cannot bypass older work.
* **provider calls:** remove synchronous automatic retry/backoff APIs and their
  hidden defaults. `Complete.complete`, `Complete.complete_stream`, and the
  Agent pipeline now perform exactly one provider attempt and return the typed
  result unchanged; callers own any later asynchronous attempt or runtime
  rotation.
* **agent provider configuration:** remove the lossy
  `Provider.config_of_provider_config` adapter and its orphan
  `Provider.default_api_key_env_of_kind` helper. `Builder.with_provider_config`
  now carries the exact typed provider identity, wire kind, endpoint,
  credential, headers, request path, and capability overrides through Agent
  dispatch without catalog, URL, model-name, or environment reinterpretation.
  `Builder.with_provider` and `Builder.with_provider_config` replace one another;
  the last setter selects the active provider representation.
* **pricing observation:** preserve absent cache multipliers as `float option`
  and make `Provider.estimate_cost`/`Llm_provider.Pricing.estimate_cost` return
  `Estimated | Incomplete` instead of inventing a multiplier. Pricing lookup
  accepts an optional exact provider identity, and `Agent_turn.accumulate_usage`
  now receives the typed provider config and returned model identity explicitly.
  These values remain telemetry only and never gate execution. See the
  [0.212 provider/pricing migration guide](docs/migrations/0.212-explicit-provider-pricing.md).
* **implicit recovery:** remove `Lenient_json`, `Correction_pipeline`,
  `Tool_use_recovery`, `Tool_failure_episode`, `Tool_failure_recovery`, and
  `Reflexion`. OAS no longer repairs malformed model JSON/tool calls, detects
  repeated-failure episodes, asks a hidden judge for a retry plan, or runs a
  convergence loop. Model content and typed tool failures stay on the ordinary
  provider/tool path without a second recovery decision layer.
* **tool results:** remove implicit call-time stubbing, relocation/offload
  stores (`Context_offload`, `Tool_result_store`, and
  `Content_replacement_state`), replacement events, and MCP output truncation.
  Tool and MCP content now reaches the provider unchanged.
* **tool surface:** remove selector, index, progressive-disclosure, and schema-
  disclosure layers. Every registered tool is sent with its full schema, and
  dispatch uses the exact registered name.
* **tool exposure:** remove the synchronous `Guardrails` name-filtering layer,
  per-turn filter overrides, and `Tool_set.filter`. Every caller-supplied tool
  reaches the provider unchanged; policy gates belong at the caller boundary.
* **governance:** remove the standalone approval pipeline, approval callback,
  `ApprovalRequired` hook decision, priority-rule policy
  engine, score-to-risk judge facade, parent-to-child policy channel, and its
  `Tool_op` tool-set operation algebra, along with the product-governance
  boundary lint. HITL and model judgment remain caller-owned callbacks over
  the generic hook/provider surfaces.
* **context:** remove `Context_reducer`, `Budget_strategy`, the
  `Agent.options.context_reducer` extension point, automatic compaction,
  threshold-based preparation, and overflow retry. Exact message and tool
  content is the default; a provider `ContextOverflow` is returned unchanged
  after one request. A caller that needs pruning or repair transforms its input
  before invoking OAS or handles the typed overflow outside OAS.
* **handoff:** make each target's exact name a normal tool backed by a real
  delegate closure. Remove `Agent_handoff`, `Agent_tool_name_alias`,
  `Succession`, prefixed aliases, stub handlers, transcript scans, compressed
  successor-DNA generation, and post-execution result replacement.
* **tool descriptors:** remove permission risk levels, mutation aliases,
  shell/workdir constraints, evidence roles, kinds, notes, examples, and the
  `Typed_tool_safe` permission facade and three-class concurrency taxonomy. A
  descriptor now contains only a caller-declared `Concurrent` or `Serial`
  execution mode; absence means `Serial`. Raw trace v2 and session tool
  catalogs expose only that structural mode and reject the removed fields.
* **events:** each subscriber owns a bounded FIFO with an explicit validated
  capacity and either drop-oldest or drop-newest behavior. There is no hidden
  capacity, default loss policy, or publisher-blocking mode. Queue depth,
  offered events, drained events, and drops remain observable.
* **telemetry events:** `Telemetry_bus.drain` now returns one typed decode
  result per queued event. Malformed telemetry remains in-order as explicit
  `decode_failure` evidence instead of disappearing from the observation
  stream.
* **event projections:** remove `Event_forward`,
  `Relay_delivery`, `Slot_scheduler_event_bridge`, and the orphan
  `SlotSchedulerObserved` payload. OAS retains the typed Event_bus and provider
  slot snapshot; external file/custom delivery and product scheduler projection
  belong to caller-owned connectors.
* **runtime control:** remove the orphan SDK-client permission taxonomy, session
  policy snapshot, `Sdk_client_types`, and Runtime permission/hook control
  channel. Session start, spawn, and finalize no longer wait on implicit control
  requests or a fixed timeout; a caller may still reject a tool explicitly with
  the generic typed `Hooks.Block` decision. Runtime stdio now accepts only
  canonical protocol envelopes. This hard cut is reported as Runtime protocol
  version `oas-runtime-0.2`.
* **runtime MCP:** remove the request policy carrier that no provider transport
  consumed. It no longer changes cache keys or advertises tool names that were
  absent from the actual provider request.
* **heuristic evaluation:** remove `Uncertain`, `Response_harness`, and
  `Checkpoint_validation`. Their confidence defaults, free-form first-number
  score extraction, and compressed-text token-overlap/marker grading are no
  longer SDK behavior.
* **harness:** keep turn counts as observations only; remove `Sandbox_runner`,
  turn/tool-count pass/fail assertions, and performance ceilings.
* **experiments:** remove `Code_snippet_eval` and its
  `OAS_EXPERIMENTAL_CODE_SNIPPET` environment gate. OAS no longer owns an
  arbitrary numeric adoption verdict for a caller's tool strategy.
* **wire observation:** remove OAS-owned capture files, paths, locks, queues,
  capacities, environment activation, and writer lifecycles. Streaming callers
  may supply one typed nonblocking offer that receives redacted provider chunks;
  caller rejection and ordinary callback exceptions become typed telemetry
  without changing the provider result. Injected transports receive only an
  OAS-owned raw-chunk sink, not the caller callback, so redaction and failure
  handling remain inside OAS. Persistence and resource policy remain entirely
  caller-owned.
* **catalog bootstrap:** remove ambient `OAS_MODEL_CATALOG`,
  `OAS_PROVIDER_CATALOG`, and `OAS_CAPABILITY_MANIFEST` discovery. The embedded
  OAS model catalog is the default; callers install explicit model, provider,
  or capability overrides through the typed `load_file`/`set_global` APIs.
* **catalog identity:** remove dot-qualified model-id rewriting and provider
  registry alias/case normalization, including the legacy `Model_registry`
  facade. Provider-independent model selection uses declared prefixes, while
  provider-scoped capability selection requires the complete normalized
  provider/model pair. Runtime provider binding accepts the exact registered
  provider id. Provider-catalog aliases remain local to explicit catalog
  lookup and are never registered as runtime provider identities.
* **environment configuration:** remove the unused numeric, boolean, list, and
  key-value policy parsers from `Llm_provider.Cli_common_env`, remove the
  environment-backed `Defaults` facade, and retire the stale
  config-externalization guide. Runtime behavior belongs in explicit typed
  configuration; the module retains only provider-bootstrap string lookup and
  trimming helpers.
* **durable workflows:** remove the separate `Durable` typed step-chain engine.
  `Durable_event` remains the generic append/replay journal; callers own job and
  workflow orchestration.
* **test support:** remove the production `Provider_mock` module and top-level
  re-export. Scripted provider responses remain test-only code, not an SDK
  runtime provider.
* **eval/harness execution stack:** remove the nine unwired
  `Agent_sdk` module re-exports — `Eval_baseline`, `Eval_report`,
  `Eval_collector`, `Eval_otel_bridge`, `Harness_case`, `Harness_dataset`,
  `Harness_report`, `Harness_runner`, and `Trace_eval` — along with the
  backing modules, `Eval.run_metrics`'s `trace_summary` field, and
  `Eval.{compare_statistical,run_metrics_to_json,set_trace_summary}`.
  The stack's only entry point (`oas eval` CLI) was deleted in #1814; the
  execution chain had zero production consumers since. Shared types
  (`Agent_sdk.Harness.verdict`) and the residual `Eval.create_collector`
  test surface stay. See PR #2689.

### Features

* **durable execution:** add an optional typed terminal-disposition sink to
  `Agent.execution_store`. After the terminal journal commit it distinguishes
  safe locator retirement from operator repair required for an admitted Tool
  attempt whose external effect outcome is unknown, without changing the
  existing Agent run surfaces or classifying error strings (#2687).

### Bug Fixes

* **eval collection:** atomically cancel and drain event-bus subscriptions
  before finalizing metrics so already accepted lifecycle and tool events are
  not discarded.
* **runtime lifecycle:** reject participant registration on an already closed
  switch, keep a settlement handle for cancellation races, cancel every
  snapshotted session lane before joining any one lane, and preserve reserved
  exceptions across runtime observer boundaries. Non-fatal event-bus,
  participant-failure persistence, and unexpected participant-lane failures
  are also emitted as runtime `System_message` observations without rolling
  back durable events or cancelling unrelated lanes.
* **checkpoint persistence:** add a finite one-way migration for the closed set
  of exact released v5/v6 checkpoint JSON shapes before strict v8 decoding.
  Released v5 had pre-preserve capped, preserve capped, and preserve unbounded
  top-level shapes without a checkpoint-version bump. Retired cap values are
  type-checked and removed, missing pre-release fields are filled only with
  `null`/empty structural values, and partial or cross-era combinations are
  rejected. Usage pricing gaps, legacy failed tool results, and MCP session
  records are normalized without inventing model identity, failure provenance,
  or an HTTP reconnect URL. Legacy MCP sessions are rejected when reconnecting
  stdio would widen their saved subprocess environment; released HTTP policy
  metadata is removed because HTTP reconnect never consumed it. Versions 1-4
  remain unsupported and the v8 domain is not widened; see the [checkpoint
  migration guide](docs/migrations/checkpoint-v5-v6-to-v8.md).
* **agent resume:** make an explicitly supplied `Agent.resume ~config` the
  complete runtime configuration SSOT. Checkpoints still restore conversation,
  usage, turn count, and context, but can no longer overwrite the caller's
  current agent name, model, system prompt, sampling, reasoning, or tool-choice
  configuration. When `~config` is omitted, persisted checkpoint configuration
  fields are restored over current defaults; runtime fields not represented by
  the checkpoint use those defaults.
* **defaults:** restore `Mcp_http.default_config` as a compatibility value; use
  `Mcp_http.make_default_config ()` for call-time environment resolution.
* **agent:** reject configured MCP servers explicitly when a required runtime
  resource is absent instead of silently omitting every server. Every MCP
  connection requires a switch; only stdio MCP additionally requires a process
  manager, so HTTP-only configurations remain usable without one. Reject
  wrong-typed optional config fields and ambiguous MCP transport objects;
  required MCP connection setup is transactional and rolls back every earlier
  connection in LIFO order without replacing the primary failure.
  Remove the inert inline `Agent_config.tools` type and parser surface; tools
  are executable values registered in code or discovered through configured
  MCP servers, never schema-only JSON entries that are rejected later.
* **provider parsing:** reject malformed provider-catalog roots, entries,
  duplicate/unknown fields, scalar/list types, auth/capability shapes, and
  malformed Ollama message bodies instead of coercing them to defaults,
  unauthenticated configs, or empty successful responses.
* **provider requests:** resolve tool-choice validation and OpenAI-compatible
  serialization from the same typed provider/model capability projection, so
  a provider-level default cannot override an exact model declaration.
* **checkpoint stages:** give the post-context-injection snapshot its own
  `After_context_injection` stage and checkpoint id instead of overwriting the
  earlier `After_tool_results_appended` snapshot for the same turn.
* **tool observability:** emit durable/raw-trace execution lifecycle records
  only after `PreToolUse` returns `Continue`. `Block` remains model-visible but
  no longer fabricates `Tool_called`/`Tool_completed` evidence for a tool that
  did not run. Post-hook and hook-observer failures propagate explicitly after
  an already completed tool has been recorded.
* **runtime evidence:** keep participant failure cause and completion anomaly
  as typed single sources of truth. Live, completed, and failed lifecycle
  payloads now share one nested common record but expose disjoint outcome
  fields; a failed event requires a cause and a completed event cannot carry
  one. Legacy flat/error shapes and non-positive dropped-delta counts are
  rejected instead of being silently preferred or erased.
* **HTTP deadlines:** distinguish expiry of the caller-owned non-streaming body
  deadline from an `Eio.Time.Timeout` raised inside the selected transport. An
  inner timeout now propagates unchanged instead of being relabelled as the
  outer body deadline.
* **harness replay:** preserve an exact zero response-step count instead of
  fabricating a minimum turn, and fail a live fixture explicitly when its
  advertised raw trace cannot be read instead of silently grading without the
  trajectory. Turn counts remain observation-only metrics.

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **llm_provider:** a Document block sent to an OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions row that does not declare `supports_document_input`, or to the Ollama native wire, now fails with a named error instead of silently going out as an image.

## [0.208.0](https://github.com/jeong-sik/oas/compare/v0.207.28...v0.208.0) (2026-06-30)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **catalog:** provider API-key and thinking-budget env var names are renamed (e.g. PROVIDER_C_API_KEY -> KIMI_API_KEY). Deployment configs, .env files, and any masc OAS-spawn env must move to the brand names.
* **agent:** the public Tool_retry_policy module, the Error.ToolRetryExhausted variant, the agent options.tool_retry_policy field, and Builder.with_tool_retry_policy are removed. Consumers relying on a tool-validation retry cap must rely on the agent loop guard (max_turns / idle / token budget) instead.
* **pipeline:** Callers relying on automatic wrapper unwrap will now receive validation errors. The LLM must send parameters as flat JSON objects at the top level.
* Error.A2a and the a2a_* constructors are removed from the public sdk_error API. Consumers matching Error.A2a must drop that arm. masc-mcp consumes agent_sdk via a git pin; its ~20 Error.A2a match arms will be compiler-forced to update when it adopts the new commit (separate follow-up).
* removes the public Completion_contract, Completion_contract_id, and Completion_contract_violation_detail modules from agent_sdk, the CompletionContractViolation error variant (Error.sdk_error / Error_domain.sdk_error_poly), and the Agent builder function with_required_tool_satisfaction. Consumers that matched on these types or relied on the SDK raising CompletionContractViolation for a missing required tool must remove those matchers and detect the condition themselves (inspect the response for a ToolUse block).

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **agent:** the public Tool_retry_policy module, the Error.ToolRetryExhausted variant, the agent options.tool_retry_policy field, and Builder.with_tool_retry_policy are removed. Consumers relying on a tool-validation retry cap must rely on the agent loop guard (max_turns / idle / token budget) instead.
* **pipeline:** Callers relying on automatic wrapper unwrap will now receive validation errors. The LLM must send parameters as flat JSON objects at the top level.
* Error.A2a and the a2a_* constructors are removed from the public sdk_error API. Consumers matching Error.A2a must drop that arm. masc-mcp consumes agent_sdk via a git pin; its ~20 Error.A2a match arms will be compiler-forced to update when it adopts the new commit (separate follow-up).
* removes the public Completion_contract, Completion_contract_id, and Completion_contract_violation_detail modules from agent_sdk, the CompletionContractViolation error variant (Error.sdk_error / Error_domain.sdk_error_poly), and the Agent builder function with_required_tool_satisfaction. Consumers that matched on these types or relied on the SDK raising CompletionContractViolation for a missing required tool must remove those matchers and detect the condition themselves (inspect the response for a ToolUse block).

## [0.204.0](https://github.com/jeong-sik/oas/compare/v0.203.2...v0.204.0) (2026-06-06)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* Error.A2a and the a2a_* constructors are removed from the public sdk_error API. Consumers matching Error.A2a must drop that arm. masc-mcp consumes agent_sdk via a git pin; its ~20 Error.A2a match arms will be compiler-forced to update when it adopts the new commit (separate follow-up).
* removes the public Completion_contract, Completion_contract_id, and Completion_contract_violation_detail modules from agent_sdk, the CompletionContractViolation error variant (Error.sdk_error / Error_domain.sdk_error_poly), and the Agent builder function with_required_tool_satisfaction. Consumers that matched on these types or relied on the SDK raising CompletionContractViolation for a missing required tool must remove those matchers and detect the condition themselves (inspect the response for a ToolUse block).
* remove migrated CDAL modules + façade re-exports (RFC-OAS-011 OAS-E PR-6)

### Code Refactoring

* remove migrated CDAL modules + façade re-exports (RFC-OAS-011 OAS-E PR-6) ([c5b120d](https://github.com/jeong-sik/oas/commit/c5b120d6f04eb8ea203dec2d1ffc5f8920656cdf))

## [0.203.2](https://github.com/jeong-sik/oas/compare/v0.203.1...v0.203.2) (2026-06-06)


### Miscellaneous Chores

* **oas:** format streaming timeout tests ([#1932](https://github.com/jeong-sik/oas/issues/1932)) ([4041753](https://github.com/jeong-sik/oas/commit/4041753b8f5c26b9013c4b7dec9435eea450fdc8))

## [0.203.0](https://github.com/jeong-sik/oas/compare/v0.202.0...v0.203.0) (2026-06-04)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* Error.A2a and the a2a_* constructors are removed from the public sdk_error API. Consumers matching Error.A2a must drop that arm. masc-mcp consumes agent_sdk via a git pin; its ~20 Error.A2a match arms will be compiler-forced to update when it adopts the new commit (separate follow-up).
* removes the public Completion_contract, Completion_contract_id, and Completion_contract_violation_detail modules from agent_sdk, the CompletionContractViolation error variant (Error.sdk_error / Error_domain.sdk_error_poly), and the Agent builder function with_required_tool_satisfaction. Consumers that matched on these types or relied on the SDK raising CompletionContractViolation for a missing required tool must remove those matchers and detect the condition themselves (inspect the response for a ToolUse block).
* remove migrated CDAL modules + façade re-exports (RFC-OAS-011 OAS-E PR-6)

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* Memory, lesson-memory, and memory-tool modules are removed from the public SDK surface. Host applications that need durable memory should own it outside `agent_sdk` and project only the data they need into OAS turns.

### Features

* remove memory API surface ([#1926](https://github.com/jeong-sik/oas/issues/1926)) ([e705946](https://github.com/jeong-sik/oas/commit/e7059466a07a017472208c75b8a72257f5863871))

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* Error.A2a and the a2a_* constructors are removed from the public sdk_error API. Consumers matching Error.A2a must drop that arm. masc-mcp consumes agent_sdk via a git pin; its ~20 Error.A2a match arms will be compiler-forced to update when it adopts the new commit (separate follow-up).

### Features

* remove dead A2a error variant from sdk_error ([#1903](https://github.com/jeong-sik/oas/issues/1903)) ([7edc393](https://github.com/jeong-sik/oas/commit/7edc39375d6260943c972bd510be4b51af9c4cc3))

Load with `Capability_manifest.load_file` and install with `Capability_manifest.set_global` to resolve the §5.1 0/13 catalog miss + 16:42 runtime drift WARN. WORKAROUND: cipher catalog plane still in place via `base_label: provider_d_chat`; removal target = Phase 1 sweep completion (variant + file rename) per RFC §6.1.

## [0.193.0] - 2026-05-09

### BREAKING CHANGES

- **CDAL framework relocated to `masc_mcp.cdal_runtime`** (RFC-OAS-011). The
  Contract-Driven Agent Loop modules previously hosted in `agent_sdk` were
  consumer-side governance only ever used by `masc-mcp`; their presence in
  the SDK was a layering violation surfaced by RFC-OAS-009 v2. All 23
  modules now live in `masc_mcp.cdal_runtime` (jeong-sik/masc-mcp); `agent_sdk`
  no longer exposes them.

  Modules removed from `Agent_sdk`:
  `Cdal_proof`, `Mode_enforcer`, `Mode_resolver`, `Risk_contract`,
  `Risk_class`, `Execution_mode`, `Proof_capture`, `Proof_store`,
  `Contract_runner`, `Effect_evidence`, `Direct_evidence`, `Verified_output`,
  `Conformance`, `Cognitive_event`, `Audit`, `Autonomy_exec`,
  `Autonomy_diff_guard`, `Autonomy_trace_analyzer`, `Sessions_proof`,
  `Runtime_evidence`. Façade re-exports from `lib/agent_sdk.{ml,mli}`
  also dropped (#1489).

  Migration: external consumers should depend on `masc_mcp.cdal_runtime`
  for these symbols, or define their own equivalents.

- **`lib/sessions.{ml,mli}` no longer `include module type of Sessions_proof`**
  (#1489). The proof-bundle assembly migrated with the rest of CDAL.
  `Sessions_types` and `Sessions_store` includes are unchanged. Code using
  `Agent_sdk.Sessions.proof_bundle` etc. needs to switch to
  `Masc_mcp_cdal_runtime.Sessions_proof.proof_bundle`.

### Removed

- `lib/execution_manifest.{ml,mli}` (#1486): dead module, zero callers
  across OAS+masc-mcp ecosystem. Surfaced by the expanded CDAL boundary
  lint because its mli carried `Execution_mode.t`/`Risk_class.t` fields.
- `lib/runtime_server_worker.{ml,mli}` (#1487): dead module, zero
  production callers. Removed alongside its `Runtime_evidence` 15-call
  dependency chain and three associated test files (`test_runtime_evidence`,
  `test_runtime_server_worker`, `test_runtime_worker_integration`).
- 18 CDAL test files + 4 demo executables purged (#1488): coverage
  follows the modules to `masc_mcp.cdal_runtime`. `test_tool.ml` also
  drops its `builtin_descriptor` test group (5 cases) — RFC-OAS-009 v2
  PR-B/C unwired the API and PR-6 deletes the function entirely.

### Added

- `scripts/lint-core-cdal-boundary.sh` (#1483, #1485): rg-based CI guard
  that forbids OAS core (`lib/agent`, `lib/llm_provider`, `lib/protocol`,
  `lib/base`) from referencing CDAL modules. Originally 9 prefixes
  (RFC-OAS-009 v2 PR-D), expanded to 20 (RFC-OAS-011 OAS-E PR-1) after
  inventory revealed 14 implied-CDAL prefixes (`Audit`, `Autonomy_*`,
  `Sessions_proof`, `Runtime_evidence`, etc.) had been silently leaking.
- `lib/base/tool_id.{ml,mli}`: closed Variant `Tool_id.t` module.
  Identifier moves from string SSOT to typed Variant; Phase 1 of
  RFC-OAS-008. (#1475)
- New `Boundary Lint (Core→CDAL)` GitHub Actions job (#1483): fast
  `ripgrep`-only check, runs on Drafts, ≤5 min timeout. Provides
  same-minute feedback ahead of the heavier `Build & Test` matrix.

### Changed

- `lib/agent/agent_tools.ml:68` (#1481): `concurrency_class_of_tool` no
  longer falls back to `Mode_enforcer.builtin_descriptor` when the
  Tool's descriptor is missing. Instead returns
  `Tool.Sequential_workspace` (fail-closed). Severs the first of two
  core→CDAL reverse dependencies identified by RFC-OAS-009 v2 §1.1.1.
- `lib/protocol/mcp_schema.ml:63` (#1482): drops the
  `descriptor_for_builtin_tool` alias and its inline tests.
  `mcp_tool_to_sdk_tool` now creates `Tool.t` with `descriptor = None`
  by default; consumers supply via `Tool.with_descriptor` or MCP tool
  annotation. Severs the second of the two reverse dependencies.
- `lib/agent/agent_turn.ml:137` (#1485): doc comment reword
  ("Audit log…" → "Diagnostic log…") so the expanded boundary lint
  doesn't catch a coincidental keyword in a comment that was never an
  actual `Audit` module reference.

### Reclassified (no breaking change)

- `Agent_sdk.Guardrails_async` / `Guardrail_llm` / `Guardrail_tripwire`
  intentionally **stay** in OAS core. The OAS-E boundary-lint expansion
  initially flagged them but they are SDK-native safety hooks (carried
  as record fields in `agent_types.t` / `builder.t`) — Anthropic-style
  surface, not CDAL. Documented in `scripts/lint-core-cdal-boundary.sh`.
  Their cdal_runtime copies (introduced during MM-2 migration) are now
  redundant artifacts to be retired in masc-mcp's RFC-OAS-013.

### Documentation

- `docs/rfc/RFC-OAS-008-typed-tool-identification.md`: typed tool
  identification design (Phase 1 only). Scope intentionally narrow —
  registry / lookup migration deferred. (#1474)
- `docs/rfc/RFC-OAS-009-tool-name-ignorance.md`: redefined v2 (Sever
  Core→CDAL Dependencies) supersedes the merged v1 (default_tool_entries
  cleanup). v1's original intent migrates to RFC-OAS-012 once CDAL is
  hosted by masc-mcp.
- `docs/rfc/RFC-OAS-011-cdal-migration-to-masc-mcp.md`: cross-repo CDAL
  migration plan (#1480). Records the leaf-first batch ordering, the
  zero-downtime three-step merge sequence (masc-mcp self-contained →
  OAS-side removal → opam pin bump), and Sessions facade trim handoff.
- `docs/rfc/RFC-OAS-012-tool-name-ignorance-within-cdal.md`: post-migration
  cleanup plan (#1480). RFC-OAS-009 v1's original intent
  (`default_tool_entries` empty, `classify_tool` global removal,
  `capability_snapshot.tools` schema bump) now lives inside
  `masc_mcp.cdal_runtime` rather than OAS.

### Stat

OAS-E sweep total: **-18,237 LoC** removed across 6 PRs (#1485–#1489
plus #1483). Counterpart: ~7,531 LoC migrated into
`masc_mcp.cdal_runtime` across MM-2 batches (jeong-sik/masc-mcp PRs
#14248, #14253, #14255, #14259, #14264). Net OAS lib reduction
larger than the migrated payload — most of the delta was over-tested
dead surface accumulated alongside the CDAL framework.

## [0.192.1] - 2026-05-08

### Added
- `lib/llm_provider/modality.{ml,mli}`: `Modality.priority` type with `Preserve_input_order` (default) and `Visual_first` (Gemma 4 family) variants. Stable sort within group, no behavior change for non-Gemma callers. (#1469)
- `test/test_agent_cancellation_tla_parity.ml`: OCaml mirror predicates for `specs/AgentCancellation.tla` invariants. Validates `Runtime.phase` 7-state alphabet, 3 terminal phases, and `TerminalIsStable` (terminal → non-terminal disallowed). (#1471)

### Fixed
- `examples/cli_transports_demo.ml`: unwrap `latency_ms : int option` with `-1` sentinel for unmeasured case. Build error from #1463 (latency option migration) now resolved. (#1473)
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: TLA buggy-spec gate accepts both TLC exit codes 12 (state-level) and 13 (trace-level) as expected invariant violation. `ContentReplacementState` was producing exit 13 and falling through. (#1473)
- `lib/{cognitive_event.ml,llm_provider/capabilities.ml,llm_provider/modality.{ml,mli},llm_provider/types.ml,agent/agent_lifecycle.{ml,mli}}`: ocamlformat 0.29.0 (janestreet profile) drift accumulated across #1469-#1471 merges. (#1473)

### Changed
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: deduplicate `tla-model-check` job, keep `tla-specs` only. Removes redundant runtime. (#1470)

## [0.192.0] - 2026-05-08

### Added
- `specs/AgentCancellation.tla`: TLA+ specification for agent cancellation lifecycle. 7-phase alphabet, 3 terminal phases, `TerminalIsStable` and `CancelledRequiresSignal` invariants. Companion `.cfg` + `-buggy.cfg` for clean/buggy parity. (#1465, #1467)
- `Lifecycle_status.t`: `[@@deriving yojson]` derivation for JSON codec. (#1467)
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: `tla-specs` CI gate runs TLC against all `specs/*.cfg` (clean) and asserts invariant violation against `specs/*-buggy.cfg`. (#1465, #1467)

## [0.191.0] - 2026-05-07

### Changed
- `Llm_provider.Llm_transport.sync_result.latency_ms`, `Types.inference_telemetry.request_latency_ms`, and `Metrics.on_request_end` now carry `int option` latency. Transports report `Some ms` only when they measured elapsed time and `None` when latency is unavailable, so telemetry JSON emits `null` instead of conflating unknown latency with a measured `0`. Downstream consumers must handle the optional field when updating their OAS pin. (#1450, #1463)

### Added
- `lib/cognitive_event.{ml,mli}`: typed JSON-codecable cognitive event schema for SDK consumers. Four variants — `Gravity_ranked`, `Intent_predicted`, `Mode_transitioned`, `Disclosure_level` — backed by `[@@deriving yojson, show]` plus a `name` label getter and an `is_well_formed` invariant checker. Host coordinators emit these; the SDK does not produce them itself in this release. The type lives here so future SDK-side consumers (Hooks, Tracing) share a single schema. RFC-0036 PR-B. (#1451)
- `Context_intent.Cognitive_op` variant: routes to `Skip` retrieval depth so coordinator hosts can request classification without triggering heavy retrieval. RFC-0036 Extension A. (#1453)
- Transport CLI configs (`codex`, `claude_code`, `kimi_cli`, `gemini_cli`) expose `clock` and `stdout_idle_timeout_s` options to bound subprocess silence. Both must be `Some _` for the idle bound to engage. (#1458, #1459, #1460, #1461)
- `Provider_adapter`: map transport errors to typed provider errors. (#1448)
- Execution manifest carries risk-class cascade defaults. (#1441)
- Contract carries quota allocations. (#1443)
- Cascade timeout attempt diagnostics. (#1452)
- CLI stdout recovery metadata exposed via `recovered_exit_code` field. (#1457)
- `test/test_cognitive_event.ml`: 5 alcotest cases (label stability, well-formed accepts, well-formed rejects 12 invalid inputs, yojson roundtrip, yojson rejects garbage). (#1451)

### Fixed
- `Cascade`: stop provider terminal fallthrough. (#1454)
- `Tool_selector`: replace `failwith` with empty list for unimplemented LLM categorical classifier (still fails loudly via downstream contract checks; localized to one classifier site). (#1455)
- Warn on invalid CLI integer env. (#1456)
- `Types.api_response.usage`: preserve missing response usage instead of defaulting to zero. (#1449)
- `Agent`: stop periodic callbacks on cancellation. (#1447)

### Internal
- `scripts/check-sdk-independence.sh`: 2-tier scan with `--include-tests` and `--strict-tests` flags; OCaml comment heuristic + `boundary-allow` markers for intentional historical references. (#1462)
- Test fixtures neutralized of coordinator-specific vocabulary; long-standing migration / incident comments tagged with `boundary-allow`. (#1462)
- Restore SDK independence after merges that re-introduced coordinator terminology in `lib/` doc comments. (#1464)
- `chore(fmt)`: format execution manifest defaults; ocamlformat applied to contract + test_contract. (#1445, #1446)


## [0.190.26] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed
## [0.190.25] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed
- `Complete_cascade` provider-health tracker now uses `Eio.Mutex.lock`/`unlock` instead of `Stdlib.Mutex` + `Fun.protect`. The cascade path runs on Eio, so a `Stdlib.Mutex` waiter would block the whole domain rather than yield through the scheduler. This is one concrete cancellation hotspot retired from the broader cancellation-guard epic — not the whole epic. Refs: jeong-sik/masc-mcp#10395, jeong-sik/masc-mcp#11929. (#1435)

### Added
- `test/test_complete_cascade.ml`: concurrent Eio fiber regression that records provider failures through the shared health tracker, proving the new `Eio.Mutex` path is safe under concurrent updates. (#1435)
- `test/dune`: re-wired `test_runtime` (worker integration) and `test_structured_stream` as standalone test stanzas, clearing the last entries from the compile-failure orphan list. (#1434, #1436)

## [0.190.24] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- `test/dune`: re-wired `test_guardrails_async` as a standalone focused suite, removing it from the compile-failure orphan list. (#1432)

### Changed
- `test/test_guardrails_async.ml`: guarded-call assertions updated to the current final-unit API shape. 14 tests pass under the focused dune build. (#1432)

## [0.190.23] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- `test/dune`: re-wired `test_event_integration` as a standalone test stanza with its Eio/Cohttp dependencies, removing it from the compile-failure orphan list. (#1430)

### Changed
- `test/test_event_integration.ml`: replaced the stale private `Handoff` type reference with the public `Subagent.to_handoff_target` helper so the suite compiles against the current `lib/agent` interface. 5 tests pass under the focused dune build. (#1430)

## [0.190.22] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed
- `Llm_provider.Retry` now classifies the provider message `"Your account has exceeded the API usage limit"` as **hard account-level quota exhaustion** rather than a transient rate limit, so `Complete_cascade.complete_cascade` halts immediately instead of burning retries on the dead provider and cascading into fallback work. Surfaces the terminal quota state to callers without the wasted attempts. Related: jeong-sik/masc-mcp#11929. (#1428)

### Added
- `test/test_complete_cascade.ml`: cascade regression proving hard-quota classification stops without invoking fallback providers; the existing nonpositive `attempt_timeout_s` sentinel regression wired into the `complete_cascade` Alcotest suite; cascade test header updated to reflect current mocked-transport coverage. (#1428)
- `test/dune` + `test/test_deep_coverage.ml`: re-wired `test_deep_coverage` and restored the Alcotest runner for the active deep-coverage sections (74 tests). The commented A2A task-store section is left untouched per its dead-body status. (#1427)

## [0.190.21] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- `test/dune`: re-wired `test_agent_card` as a standalone test stanza, removing it from the compile-fail orphan list. (#1425)

### Fixed
- `test/test_agent_card.ml`: removed the stale `cascade` field from the `Agent_card.agent_info` fixture; the field was dropped from the production type but the orphaned test still populated it, blocking compile. (#1425)

## [0.190.20] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- `Eval_otel_bridge.to_metrics_json`: each exported metric object now carries a `tags` field with `agent_name` and `run_id`, so dashboards and report consumers can join JSON metrics back to the originating eval run without out-of-band context. The native OTel summary span already carried this correlation; the JSON export path was the gap. (#1423)

### Fixed
- `lib/eval_otel_bridge.ml` and `test/test_eval_otel_bridge.ml`: ocamlformat auto-promote on the new `to_metrics_json` correlation-tags blocks. #1423 was merged with the OCaml Format check failing (non-required gate), so the canonical breakdown of the new `match` arm and the long `Yojson.Safe.Util.(...)` chain landed unfmt; the bump captures the auto-promote as a single restart.

## [0.190.19] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- `test/dune`: re-wired `test_full_pipeline_cov` as a standalone test stanza, removing the last entry from the `pre-existing runtime failures` orphan list. (#1421)

### Fixed
- `test/test_full_pipeline_cov.ml`: canned mock provider response text is now JSON-escaped before being embedded in the response body string, so the structured-JSON parse path under test no longer fails on unescaped quotes/backslashes inside the mocked content. (#1421)

## [0.190.18] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- `test/dune`: re-wired `test_cli` as a standalone test stanza with full provider/runtime libraries (`cohttp-eio`, `eio_main`, `str`, `unix`, `yojson`) and `OAS_RUNTIME_PATH` env wiring so the CLI version/init/card/help/eval suite can locate the runtime binary inside the dune sandbox. (#1419)

## [0.190.17] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- `test/dune`: re-wired `test_builder` as an Eio-enabled standalone test stanza. (#1417)

### Changed
- `test/test_builder.ml` `extract_token_budget`: helper now recursively traverses `Context_reducer.Dynamic` strategies via a probe message large enough to drive the dynamic selector into its budgeted branch, so `from_context_config` assertions inspect the realized strategy shape instead of bailing on `Dynamic`. (#1417)

## [0.190.16] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- `test/dune`: re-wired `test_api` as a standalone test stanza. (#1415)

### Changed
- `test/test_api.ml`: SSE unknown-event and malformed-JSON assertions updated to expect the structured parser error variants emitted by the current `Streaming.parse_sse_event` contract, replacing the previous `None`-return expectations. (#1415)

## [0.190.15] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- `test/dune`: re-wired `test_lenient_json` as a focused stanza, removing it from the runtime-failure orphan list. (#1413)

### Changed
- `Lenient_json.parse`: `maybe_unwrap_string` now also triggers when the inner string starts with `"`, matching the existing recovery transform's behavior so triple-stringified JSON strings are unwrapped consistently with double-stringified objects/arrays. Trigger condition expanded from `t.[0] = '{' || t.[0] = '['` to `t.[0] = '{' || t.[0] = '[' || t.[0] = '"'`. (#1413)

## [0.190.14] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- `test/dune`: re-wired `test_complete_http`, `test_streaming`, and `test_llm_provider_cov` as focused test stanzas. Removes them from the runtime-failure orphan list and restores coverage for HTTP request metrics shaping, SSE typed-error parsing, and Gemini thinking-budget defaults. (#1408, #1410, #1411)

### Changed
- `test/test_complete_http.ml`: tests now construct `Metrics.t` via `{ Metrics.noop with on_cache_hit = ...; ... }` so they tolerate new optional metric callbacks (`on_capability_drop`, etc.) added since the suite was orphaned. (#1408)
- `test/test_streaming.ml`: `test_parse_invalid_json` and `test_parse_unknown_event_type` now assert the typed `SSEParseFailed` and `SSEUnknownEventType` variants instead of the previous `None` return, matching the current `Streaming.parse_sse_event` contract. (#1410)
- `test/test_llm_provider_cov.ml`: Gemini thinking default assertion follows `Constants.Thinking.gemini_budget ()` instead of the previously hard-coded value, so environment overrides flow through. (#1411)

## [0.190.13] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- `Structured.schema_to_json_schema` exposes the provider-native object schema generated from a typed schema, and `Structured.schema_extractor` lets `run_structured` callers reuse the same fenced-JSON parsing and `schema.parse` validation as direct structured extraction. (#1405)
- `test/dune`: re-wired `test_provider_bridge` and `test_provider_complete` as focused provider test stanzas, restoring coverage for ZAI coding auto-model order, GLM request shaping, Anthropic prompt caching, and structured-output rejection. (#1406)

### Fixed
- `Backend_anthropic.build_request` now requires both `cache_system_prompt = true` AND `String.length s >= prompt_cache_min_chars` to mark the system prompt cacheable (changed `||` → `&&`). Short system prompts stay plain strings even when the user opts into caching, matching Anthropic's documented minimum prompt length gate. (#1406)

### Changed
- `test/test_provider_bridge.ml`: ZAI coding auto-model default order updated to `[glm-5-code; glm-5.1; glm-5; glm-5-turbo; glm-4.7; glm-4.5-air]`. (#1406)
- `test/test_provider_complete.ml`: `test_glm_preserved_reasoning_replay_and_auto_tool_choice` renamed to `..._drops_unsupported_tool_choice` and assertion changed from "tool_choice coerced to auto" to "tool_choice key absent from request" to match current production behavior. Output-schema rejection assertion loosened from `"json mode only"` to `"json mode"`. (#1406)

## [0.190.12] - 2026-05-05

### Changed
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: extracted the duplicated "Pin fork packages" + 3-attempt `opam install . --deps-only --with-test --yes` retry block from the `build-and-test` and `lint` jobs into a single shared script `scripts/ci-setup-deps.sh`. Both jobs now invoke `opam exec -- bash scripts/ci-setup-deps.sh`. Removes ~28 lines of duplication and one drift surface (fork SHA / retry policy now changes in one place).
- `CLAUDE.md`: removed the literal `0.184.0` from the SDK version SSOT line (drifted vs `lib/sdk_version.ml`); coverage convention reworded from aspirational `75%+` to the actual CI ratchet floor pattern referenced from `ci.yml` `THRESHOLD`.

## [0.190.11] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- `Agent_sdk.Log.dropped_without_sink_count` exposes how many enabled log records were discarded because no sink was registered, allowing hosts to detect missing telemetry wiring without forcing stderr output. `Log.emit` reads `global_sinks` first and only allocates a record on the `sinks` arm, so the no-sink path stays cheap. `clear_sinks` now also resets the dropped counter so isolated tests start at 0. (#1402)

### Changed
- `lib/agent/agent.ml` per-turn log docstring reworded from "the record is counted and otherwise discarded" to "enabled emit attempt is counted and dropped without allocating a record" so it matches the actual `Log.emit` no-sink branch behavior. (#1402)

## [0.190.10] - 2026-05-05

### Changed
- `Mode_enforcer.record_effect_evidence` now stores the repo-relative path produced by `__FILE__` (e.g. `lib/mode_enforcer.ml`) in `source_path` instead of the basename-only payload introduced in 0.190.9. The repo-relative form preserves directory context while still being build-environment independent. The corresponding `test/test_cdal.ml` substring assertion was tightened to fail on basename-only regressions. (#1400)

### Added
- `test_circuit_open_skips_provider_and_falls_back` regression in `test/test_complete_cascade.ml`: proves an OPEN provider is skipped and the next provider in the cascade succeeds without invoking the open one. (#1400)

## [0.190.9] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- `Complete_cascade.provider_health_info` carries `circuit_open`, `health_score`, `consecutive_failures`, and `cooldown_remaining_s`. `provider_health_scores` exposes a list helper. `Execution_manifest` gains `provider_health` and optional `cascade_config`. `Effect_evidence` records carry `source_path`/`source_line`. `Agent_sdk` re-exports `Execution_manifest`. (#1398)

### Changed
- `circuit_open_and_remaining` returns `(false, None)` once the cooldown has elapsed instead of `(false, Some 0.0)`; the `.mli` documents the `cooldown_remaining_s` invariant. `Mode_enforcer.record_effect_evidence` writes `Filename.basename __FILE__` so evidence rows do not leak absolute build paths. (#1398)

## [0.190.8] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- `test/test_pipeline_deep.ml` orphan stanza rescue. `Hooks.turn_params` literal 한 곳에 누락된 `enable_thinking = None` 을 추가해 22 alcotest 케이스가 default runtest 신호에 합류. 같은 sprint-b orphan rescue 시리즈 (#1388/#1392/#1394) 의 일부. (#1394)

## [0.190.7] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- `test/test_discovery.ml` orphan stanza rescue. orphan 사유 "(record missing 'supports_tools')" 가 stale — `props` 레코드 literal 한 곳에 `supports_tools = None` 추가 후 8 alcotest 케이스 default runtest 신호에 합류. (#1392)

### Tests
- `test_event_bus.ml` 의 Custom event payload fixture 를 masc-specific `masc.keeper.lifecycle` 에서 downstream-neutral `downstream.agent.lifecycle` 로 교체. SDK 레이어 테스트가 특정 컨슈머 namespace 에 결합되는 것 방지. (#1393)

## [0.190.6] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- `Agent_sdk` top-level mli/ml 의 base 모듈 re-export 들을 `Agent_sdk_base.*` 로 명시 qualify. `agent_sdk.base` `wrapped: true` 전환 (#1385) 이후 `Agent_sdk.cmi` 가 global `Types`/`Error` 인터페이스를 import 하던 잔존 의존을 제거. ocamlobjinfo 기준 `Agent_sdk_base__Types`, `Agent_sdk_base__Error` 만 import 하도록 정리. (#1389)

## [0.190.5] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- `test/test_provider_config.ml` orphan stanza rescue. orphan 사유 "(record missing 'reasoning_tokens_estimated')" 가 stale 였음 — 필드는 `lib/llm_provider/types.mli:182` 에 이미 존재했고 다른 callsite 도 `; reasoning_tokens_estimated = false` 명시. `inference_telemetry` literal 한 곳만 누락되어 한 줄 추가 후 47 alcotest 케이스 다시 default runtest 신호에 합류. (#1388)

## [0.190.4] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- `Relay_delivery` 프리미티브: persist-then-publish 패턴을 위한 2-stage delivery state machine + retry queue + stats. `Runtime_health` probe 도 함께 노출. (#1383)

### Changed
- `agent_sdk.base` 라이브러리 `wrapped: true` 로 전환. `Agent_sdk` 가 `Agent_sdk_base` 전체를 `re_export` 하고 `Result_syntax` 를 포함한 모든 base 모듈을 top-level alias 로 노출. 직접 `agent_sdk.base` 의존하던 다운스트림은 `agent_sdk` 또는 qualified `Agent_sdk_base.*` 경로로 마이그레이션. (#1385)

### Build
- 신규 `.github/workflows/pr-automation.yml` Draft Auto-Merge Guard: human approval 라벨 없는 PR 의 auto-merge 활성화 + draft 해제를 자동 차단. labels REST 페이지네이션 사용, `allow-auto-merge` 빌트인 라벨은 명시적으로 bypass 후보에서 제외. (#1384, fixes #1278)

## [0.190.3] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- `Capability_manifest`: 성공한 매니페스트 로드를 `Diag.info` 로 승격해 운영자가 디버그 플래그 없이도 override 레이어 활성화를 확인할 수 있게 함. 잘못된 JSON 타입(예: bool 자리에 string)은 silent fallback 대신 `Diag.warn` 으로 보고. `member_int` 가 Yojson 의 `Intlit` 변형도 명시적으로 처리해 큰 정수 리터럴이 잘못된 "expected int, got int" 메시지로 무시되는 문제 해결. `Diag.with_sink` 의 mli 가 테스트/단일 스레드 부트스트랩 전용 의도를 명시. (#1381, fixes #1372)

## [0.190.2] - 2026-05-05

### Build
- `test/dune` 의 wired stanza 들이 `Transport.find_runtime` 호출 시 sandbox cwd 에서 `_build/default/bin/oas_runtime.exe` 를 못 찾는 문제 해결. 두 단계로 처리:
  - `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: Test/Coverage step 에 `OAS_RUNTIME_PATH=${{ github.workspace }}/_build/default/bin/oas_runtime.exe` 환경변수 export. Coverage step 의 `dune clean` 이후엔 `dune build bin/oas_runtime.exe` 도 추가. (#1377)
  - `test/dune`: 모든 wired `(tests ...)` 와 `test_complete_cascade` stanza 에 `(deps %{bin:oas-runtime})` + `(action (setenv OAS_RUNTIME_PATH %{bin:oas-runtime} (run %{test})))` 추가. self-contained 동작 — 로컬 `dune runtest` 도 더 이상 환경변수 의존성 없음. (#1378)
- 이전에 wired 안 돼 있던 100+ 테스트 모듈을 `test/dune` 에 그룹화 stanza 로 정식 wiring. 기존에 실수로 격리돼 있던 회귀 테스트들이 CI 의 default runtest 신호에 합류. compile-fail / pre-existing 실패 suite 는 헤더 코멘트로 명시 skip 처리. (#1374)

## [0.190.1] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- `Complete_cascade.complete_cascade` honors per-kind attempt-timeout defaults (`Provider_config.default_attempt_timeout_s`) so unbounded provider waits no longer stall a turn. `Some t` with `t <= 0.0` opts out of the cascade-level timeout for callers that need to keep long-running local-model calls (e.g. an Ollama instance loading a large MoE) running to completion. Error messages render the timeout via `%g` so short test budgets like `0.01s` are not truncated to `0.0s`. Fast-path regression test now asserts elapsed wall-clock time stays below 1.0s; a broken implementation that waited the full transport sleep would fail. (#1375)

## [0.190.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- `Guardrails_async.run_output_validators` now takes a per-validator deadline (default 5s) so a single hung validator no longer stalls the whole turn. Timeouts are reported as `Timeout` rather than swallowed. (#1368)
- `Guardrails.tool_filter` defaults tightened to `DenyList []` with an explicit cap, replacing the implicit allow-all that left tool exposure unbounded by default. Existing callers passing `Allow_all` are unaffected. (#1370)

### Changed
- `Agent_turn_budget` derives `current_max`, `extensions_count`, and `total_extended` from `history` instead of carrying parallel mutable fields. Eliminates the lock-step update invariant that previously could drift on partial-failure paths. (#1364)
- `Provider_config` exposes `request_path_default_for_kind` and `output_schema_of_response_format` helpers. `make` uses them, and direct record-literal callers can pin the same defaults via the helpers instead of duplicating the per-kind table. (#1366, #1367)
- `Agent_turn` `call_time_pruner` magic numbers (token thresholds, stage hooks) externalized to a typed `call_time_pruner_config` so consumers can override per-deployment without forking. (#1371)

### Security
- `Autonomy_diff_guard` normalizes input (Unicode NFC, whitespace, and quote folding) before substring matching so guard rules cannot be bypassed by trivially-encoded variants. Adds 100+ regression cases. (#1369)

## [0.189.1] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- Ollama dynamic capability discovery via `/api/show`: `Discovery` overlays Ollama-reported tool/multimodal/JSON capabilities on top of the static capability table when probing Ollama endpoints. Pure capability merge with no new public API. (#1362)

### Fixed
- DashScope structured output now goes through `validate_output_schema_request` correctly. The validator previously gated only on `config.output_schema`, allowing callers to construct a `Provider_config.t` with `response_format = JsonSchema _` and `output_schema = None` and silently bypass GLM/DashScope tightening. The new helper `structured_schema_requested` treats either field as a native-schema request. (#1360)

### Tests
- Added `prefix_ordering` regression suite for `Capabilities.for_model_id`: every shadow pair (longer prefix shadowed by an earlier shorter prefix) is asserted to resolve to the more-specific branch. Anti-pattern M01: silent capability mismatch when prefixes are reordered. (#1361)

## [0.189.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- `Capability_manifest` module: explicitly loaded external JSON manifest for runtime model capability overrides. Supports prefix-matching, schema-version gating, and per-model boolean/int overrides for tool-use, structured-output, multimodal, sampling, and reasoning capabilities. (#1347)
- `Pricing.pricing_entry` type and dynamic pricing override API:
  `install_pricing_overrides`, `clear_pricing_overrides`,
  `pricing_entry_of_json`, `parse_pricing_entries_json`,
  `load_pricing_file`, `pricing_overrides_from_env`.
  Set `OAS_PRICING_FILE` (path to a JSON array file) or
  `OAS_PRICING_OVERRIDES` (inline JSON) to override per-model pricing
  at runtime without a code release.  A `Diag.warn` fires once per
  process when installed overrides are older than 24 h (H11).

### Fixed
- SSE streaming parse failures and unknown event types are now surfaced via the new `SSEParseFailed` and `SSEUnknownEventType` events, both in `Llm_provider.Streaming.parse_sse_event` and the public `Agent_sdk.Streaming` accumulator. Previously the wildcard catch-all silently dropped malformed/unknown chunks, producing phantom completions when the cascade layer expected provider failover. (#1357)

## [0.188.1] - 2026-05-05

### Changed
- Removed unused Jane Street `base` package from opam/dune-project dependency lists. No `open Base` or `Base.<Module>` usage existed in `lib/`, `bin/`, or `test/`; the local `agent_sdk.base` sub-library is unrelated. (#1349)

### Tests
- Added regression coverage for capability-gated serializer paths in `Backend_ollama` and `Backend_openai`: `top_k` inclusion under default capabilities, `seed` capability gate, and Ollama `done_reason=tool_calls` / thinking-block parsing. (#1356)

### Docs
- Archived `RFC-OAS-006-weighted-cascade-routing` and the `CascadeFSM*` TLA+ specs to `docs/archive/2026-04/`. Aligned `RFC-tool-selector` Section 6.3 wording with the post-0.144.0 single-provider implementation. Removed dead `Cascade_config` test sections from `test_llm_provider_cov.ml` (-235 LOC) and `test_backend_gemini.ml` (-22 LOC). (#1350)

## [0.188.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- Provider cascade routing with cross-provider failover and circuit breaking (`Complete_cascade`).
- `agent_sdk.base` sub-library extraction: Types, Error, Context, Tool, Model_registry, Completion_contract_id, Result_syntax.
- `ppx_let` support via `Result_syntax.Let_syntax` module (`let%bind`, `let%map`, `and%bind`).
- LLM provider metrics module (`Metrics`) for request/response/latency tracking.
- Dynamic prompt cache alignment and context budget compaction.
- MCP CLI provider integration with Ollama dynamic capabilities.
- GLM-5-Code models and Kimi CLI model restrictions.

### Changed
- `artifact_service.ml` migrated to `let%bind`/`Let_syntax.return` style.

## [0.187.7] - 2026-05-02

### Added
- Execution Manifest with `provider_health`, `rate_limit_quota`, and Risk_class cascade mappings.

## [0.187.6] - 2026-05-01

### Fixed

- Align generated opam package metadata and runtime SDK version with the current dune project version.

## [0.187.4] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed

- Format the memory query follow-up so the CI format gate remains green after the memory prefix query merge.

## [0.187.3] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- Collaboration substrate priority/quota contract, including typed request priority and quota attribution helpers.
- Collaboration performance budget contract for downstream multi-agent UI scheduling and coalescing expectations.

## [0.187.2] - 2026-04-30

### Changed

- Version bump with opam package metadata truth synced after the v0.187.1 release cut.

## [0.187.1] - 2026-04-30

### Changed

- Version bump only (post-CI gate merge).

## [0.187.0] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- **Runtime sync/replay window contract** exposes `Agent_sdk.Runtime_sync` with stream cursors, replay window metadata, persistence capability metadata, append-only offline merge helpers, cursor-based delta filtering, schema `docs/schemas/runtime-sync-window-v1.json`, and focused coverage for downstream offline/online sync integrations.

## [0.186.0] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- **Typed provider failure transport surface** via `Llm_provider.Http_client.ProviderFailure`, covering capacity exhaustion, hard quota, capability mismatch, CLI policy invalid, CLI startup failure, provider parse failure, and unknown provider failure.
- **Runtime collaboration projection contract** adds generic presence, activity, and system-health event types plus `Runtime_projection.collaboration_events_of_event` for downstream multi-agent UIs. Presence is explicitly ephemeral and 30Hz-coalesced; no persisted collaboration runtime event kind is introduced.

### Changed

- **Gemini CLI capacity and policy failures now classify at the transport edge** instead of surfacing as `NetworkError Unknown`. `MODEL_CAPACITY_EXHAUSTED` maps to `Capacity_exhausted`, request-scoped runtime MCP rejection maps to `Capability_mismatch`, and Gemini policy warnings such as `Unrecognized tool name "glm"` map to `Cli_policy_invalid`.

## [0.185.0] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- **DeepSeek v4 provider inventory entries** for `deepseek-v4-flash` and `deepseek-v4-pro`, including model registry aliases and provider config coverage for downstream cascade routing.

### Fixed

- **Kimi CLI large-prompt handling** now routes large prompts through stdin instead of argv so OS argument length limits do not truncate or reject long requests.
- **Transport drift gate parsing** handles the split ocamlformat configuration shape used by the current tree.

### Changed

- **Test stanza layout** in `test/dune` now uses grouped `(tests ...)` stanzas for auto-discovery while preserving the same test executables and CI coverage.

## [0.184.0] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed

- **SSE keepalive comments no longer reset `stream_idle_timeout`** in `Llm_provider.Http_client.read_sse`. Per the W3C EventSource spec, lines starting with `:` are comments / keepalives and carry no event payload. Previously these lines reset the `Eio.Time.with_timeout_exn` deadline like any other line, so a provider that emitted only keepalives without ever sending `event:` / `data:` lines would never trip the idle timeout — the entire stream had to wait for the upstream consumer's hard cap (downstream observed: keeper turn-level 3600s wall-clock). Now keepalive skipping happens inside the same timeout window, preserving the deadline across an arbitrary number of keepalives. `read_ndjson` is unaffected (NDJSON has no comment concept). Public API surface unchanged; semantic of the existing `?idle_timeout` parameter is now "inter-event idle" instead of "inter-line idle". Companion regression test: `test/test_streaming_keepalive_idle.ml`.

## [0.183.0] - 2026-04-28

### Changed

- **Removed `lib/str_match.{ml,mli}` thin wrapper (#1221 via #1223).** The 4-line `Str.search_forward` wrapper was used at 6 call sites across 4 files (`approval.ml`, `harness.ml`, `hooks.ml`, `orchestrator.ml`). Folded the helper into `Util.regex_match` where the rest of the shared substring/regex utilities live. No behavioral change — the compiled `Str.search_forward` body is identical.

### Added

- **`Util.regex_match : Str.regexp -> string -> bool`.** Boolean wrapper around `Str.search_forward` that returns `false` instead of raising `Not_found`. Exposed alongside the existing `safe_sub`, `contains_substring_ci`, and `clip` helpers.

## [0.182.0] - 2026-04-28

### Added

- **`Provider_config.internal_model_rotation_count` hint (#1211).** Threaded through provider config so cascade/orchestrator layers can observe how many internal rotations a provider has performed. Read-only hint; default is 0.

### Changed

- **Removed `lib/retry.{ml,mli}` and `lib/sse_parser.{ml,mli}` thin re-export shims (#1220 via #1225).** Both files were 1-line `include Llm_provider.X` wrappers. Public surface is preserved through explicit `module Retry = Llm_provider.Retry` (and `Sse_parser`) in `lib/agent_sdk.{ml,mli}`, so external `Agent_sdk.Retry.X` access is unchanged. Internal lib/ consumers now alias `Llm_provider.Retry` per file; affected test stanzas in `test/dune` gained `llm_provider` as a `(libraries ...)` dep.

### Tests

- **Eio HTTP body cancellation regression guard (#1210).** Pins the cancellation-propagation contract for `Llm_provider.Http_client` so future edits cannot silently drop body-read interruption.
- **Register orphan `test_tool_set` with QCheck deps (#1179, via #1224).** Closes the last orphan from the #1025 series; cold-cache `dune build @check` no longer fails on `Unbound module QCheck` for `test/test_tool_set.ml`.

### Docs

- **CLAUDE.md / CONTRIBUTING.md SSOT alignment (#1215, #1216, #1217, #1218 via #1222).** Bumps the AI-assistant reference from a hardcoded `v0.149.0` to the SSOT (`lib/sdk_version.ml`), corrects the `CONTRIBUTING.md` version-source pointer (`agent_sdk.ml` → `sdk_version.ml`), and expands the Provider Support table to list `backend_anthropic`, `backend_openai`, `backend_gemini`, `backend_glm`, `backend_ollama` as the actual concrete backends.

### Closed (no code change)

- **#1219 — `Proof_store` public Read API.** Verified resolved by masc-mcp PR #11512: `proof_artifact_reader.ml` now delegates to `Oas.Proof_store.{resolve_ref, make_ref, read_json}` instead of hardcoding the OAS internal layout. The OAS-side Read API was already sufficient.

## [0.181.0] - 2026-04-27

### Added

- **`Agent.options.body_timeout_s` (`float option`).** Caps total HTTP body consumption time, distinct from `stream_idle_timeout_s` which only resets between successful lines and so cannot interrupt a single bulk read. On expiry the result is `Error (NetworkError { kind = Timeout; _ })` with a message that names the configured deadline and the `Builder.with_body_timeout` setter, so cascade/retry treats it as retryable while operators retain attribution. Requires `clock`; without one the wrapper is skipped and behaviour matches `<= 0.180.0`. Threaded through `Builder`, `Pipeline.stage_route`, and `Llm_provider.Complete.complete_stream` / `complete_stream_http`.
- `Builder.with_body_timeout : float -> t -> t` setter.
- Unit tests (`test/test_body_timeout.ml`) pin the message-prefix contract so future edits cannot silently downgrade body-deadline expiry to `kind = Unknown`.

## [0.180.0] - 2026-04-27

### Changed

- **`Provider_registry`: rename `alibaba_defaults` → `dashscope_defaults`.** Canonical name follows the `DashScope` provider kind introduced in 0.178.0. The `alibaba` registry entry remains as alias for backward compatibility, both pointing to the same defaults.

### Added

- Test coverage for `dashscope` registry lookup (max_context 131K, dashscope_capabilities).

## [0.179.0] - 2026-04-27

### Added

- **`Event_bus.payload_kind` SSOT helper.** Adds `payload_kind : payload -> string` so downstream consumers can categorize events by kind without maintaining exhaustive match sites that break on variant addition.

## [0.178.0] - 2026-04-26

### Added

- **DashScope native provider support.** Adds a first-class `DashScope` provider kind to correctly expose `supports_tool_choice=true` and `supports_min_p=true` for Qwen models, bypassing the conservative `Ollama` defaults.

## [0.177.0] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed

- **`claude_code` provider cost recovery.** `pricing_for_model_opt`
  now matches the `claude_code` and `cc:` aliases that the Claude
  Code transport surfaces in `telemetry.model_used` instead of a
  canonical model id, estimating at sonnet-4-6 rates as the modal
  Anthropic backend. Restores `cost_usd` reporting for every
  `claude_code` keeper turn (previously null because substring
  matches against opus/sonnet/haiku never fired). Per-call accuracy
  via canonical model resolution from the API response remains a
  follow-up.

## [0.176.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- **Agent-level stream idle timeout control.** `Agent.options` and
  `Builder.t` now expose `stream_idle_timeout_s`, with
  `Builder.with_stream_idle_timeout` for callers that need bounded
  streaming turns. `Pipeline_stage_route.dispatch_stream` forwards the
  value into `Complete.complete_stream`, so downstream consumers can opt
  into retryable idle timeout failures across HTTP SSE, Ollama NDJSON,
  and CLI subprocess streaming paths.

## [0.175.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- **HTTP SSE stream idle timeout parity.** `Complete.complete_stream`
  now applies `stream_idle_timeout_s` to every HTTP streaming path,
  including Anthropic, OpenAI-compatible, Gemini, GLM, and Ollama native
  NDJSON streams. The timeout remains caller-owned and surfaces stalled
  endpoints as retryable timeout-shaped network errors.
- **CLI subprocess stdout idle timeout.** Shared non-interactive CLI
  subprocess execution now accepts `?clock` and
  `?stdout_idle_timeout_s`, so silent CLI hangs can be interrupted
  without imposing a total runtime cap.

### Fixed

- **Pipeline retry honors effective tool contract.** Missing-required-tool retry
  now consults the resolved completion contract (post provider-capability
  resolution) instead of the originally requested contract. Providers that
  intentionally relax unsupported tool requirements no longer enter forced
  retry loops.
- **Per-response usage is preserved.** Ollama and CLI transports keep
  usage on each returned response instead of letting aggregate turn
  accounting overwrite or drop the provider payload.
- **Runtime participant events preserve raw trace run ids.** Runtime
  participant lifecycle events now carry `raw_trace_run_id` through to
  the top-level EventBus `run_id`, keeping generic trace correlation
  intact for downstream consumers.
- **Provider pricing entries refreshed again.** Added pricing for
  `gpt-5.5` alongside the existing current OpenAI model table refresh.

## [0.173.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- **Bounded Ollama NDJSON streams.** `Complete.complete_stream` and
  `Http_client.read_ndjson` now accept optional `?clock` and
  `?stream_idle_timeout_s`. When set, each NDJSON line read is wrapped in
  `Eio.Time.with_timeout_exn`; a stalled stream raises `Eio.Time.Timeout`,
  which `catch_network` already maps to a retryable `NetworkError`. No new
  error surface, no default injected at the SDK layer — callers decide the
  idle budget.

### Fixed

- **Provider pricing entries refreshed.** Added pricing for current
  `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.4-mini`, `gpt-5.3-codex`, and `gpt-5.2` from the
  official OpenAI rate cards. `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` left unpriced because
  the Codex rate card marks research-preview pricing as non-final.
- **Streamed `response.model` no longer blank.** When a provider omits
  `model` from the streamed final chunk, `patch_telemetry` now fills it
  from the configured `model_id` so downstream consumers receive a stable
  identifier.

## [0.172.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- **Native NDJSON streaming for Ollama.** `Complete.complete_stream_http`
  Ollama branch now speaks the native `/api/chat` endpoint and parses the
  newline-delimited JSON wire format directly, replacing the prior detour
  through Backend_openai's SSE shape. Adds `Http_client.read_ndjson`,
  `Streaming.parse_ollama_ndjson_chunk`, and
  `Streaming.ollama_chunk_to_events` as new public exports.
- **Restored Ollama timing telemetry.** Streaming responses now carry
  `prompt_eval_count`, `prompt_eval_duration`, `eval_count`, and
  `eval_duration` — the four Ollama-only fields the OpenAI compat detour
  was stripping. Token-count usage and `inference_timings` on streaming
  responses are byte-identical to the non-streaming path
  (masc-mcp #8968 / #8969).

## [0.171.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- **Strict required-tool satisfaction hooks.** Completion contracts can now
  validate required tool calls with a caller-supplied typed predicate, so
  read-only/observability tools no longer have to count as productive action
  at runtime boundaries.

## [0.170.9] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- **Truth-layer evidence primitives.** `Event_envelope`, `Effect_evidence`, and
  `Runtime_health` provide cross-runtime event causality, tool-effect decision
  evidence, and runtime health snapshot shapes. `Mode_enforcer` now records
  effect evidence for every pre-tool decision, and `Proof_capture` persists
  those rows under `evidence/effects.json` for downstream proof consumers
  (#1158).
- **`Capabilities.emits_usage_tokens` + `capabilities_for_provider_label`.**
  `Llm_provider.Capabilities.capabilities` gains an
  `emits_usage_tokens : bool` field (default `true`) that captures whether
  a provider's standard response carries `input_tokens`/`output_tokens`.
  CLI-class wrappers that strip usage before returning (`codex_cli`,
  `gemini_cli`, `kimi_cli`) declare it `false`; all direct APIs keep the
  default. A companion `capabilities_for_provider_label : string ->
  capabilities option` lookup and a matching
  `Capability_filter.emits_usage_tokens` predicate let adapters that
  track provider kind as a string query this flag without reinventing
  a provider allowlist. Downstream metrics/coverage layers (e.g.
  masc-mcp `Provider_adapter.is_structurally_unmetered_provider`) can
  now consume the SDK directly as the SSOT (#1173).

### Fixed

- **Split pipeline stages now build messages through the shared constructor.** The post-split `stage_input`, `stage_collect`, and `stage_execute` paths now use `make_message` instead of stale record literals, so newly required fields such as `metadata` stay aligned with the shared message shape and downstream pipeline builds stop breaking after the stage split (#1151).
- **Kimi CLI session reuse now matches the actual CLI contract.** `transport_kimi_cli` now passes config files via `--config-file`, keeps `--session <id>` stable across turns, and stops assuming `--continue` is valid with an explicit session id. This preserves the intended token-saving delta prompt behavior for keeper-style multi-turn sessions without relying on a CLI flag combination that `kimi` rejects.

## [0.170.8] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed

- **`scripts/release.sh` now refuses to tag from anywhere other than
  a main branch synced with `origin/main`.** Previously the script
  ran `git tag -a` against the current `HEAD`, so running it from a
  feature branch (or before the release PR was merged) left the tag
  on a release-cut commit whose SHA was rewritten by GitHub's PR
  rebase merge. The tag then pointed to a commit no longer reachable
  from main, which broke release-provenance audits and every
  downstream consumer that pinned by SHA-equivalent. The script now
  fails fast when `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` is not the
  integration branch or when local HEAD differs from `origin/main`,
  with the remediation printed inline (#1136, #1135, #1168).

## [0.170.7] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed

- **Atomic file writes no longer race on a shared tmp path.** Previously
  both `Fs_result.write_file` (blocking path) and the `Eio.Path` callers
  in `Checkpoint_store.save`, `A2a_task_store.store_task`,
  `Memory_file_backend.persist`, and `Durable_event.save_to_file` derived
  the tmp name from the target (`<path>.tmp`). Two fibers writing to the
  same logical file could therefore race, with writer A's `rename`
  consuming the shared tmp before writer B's `rename` ran, surfacing as
  `Eio.Io Fs Not_found (renameat …)`. A new `Fs_atomic_eio.save_atomic`
  helper gives every writer a unique tmp suffix (pid + wall-clock ns +
  `Atomic` counter) and best-effort fsyncs the tmp file and parent
  directory; the five call sites now delegate to this helper (or the
  unified `Fs_result.write_file`). `A2a_task_store.store_task` only
  updates its in-memory cache on `Ok`, so cache and disk can no longer
  drift when the atomic write fails after flush (#1165).

### Notes

- **Race test skipped under `BISECT_ENABLE=yes`.** `test_atomic_write_race`
  is gated off when the Coverage report job re-runs the suite with bisect
  instrumentation, because the extra io_uring submissions from bisect hooks
  blow the CI container's memlock budget and cause unrelated downstream
  tests to fail with `Unix_error(ENOMEM, "io_uring_queue_init")`. The
  happy-path line coverage of `Fs_atomic_eio.save_atomic` is retained
  indirectly via the existing `test_checkpoint_store`,
  `test_a2a_task_store`, and `test_memory_file_backend` suites (#1165).

## [0.170.6] - 2026-04-24

### Changed

- **SDK independence boundary now enforced in CI.** The `SDK Independence
  Gate` job rejects PRs that reintroduce cross-SDK imports, keeping
  `agent_sdk` consumable without pulling downstream-specific modules
  (#1160).

## [0.170.5] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- **Truth-layer evidence primitives.** New types and helpers for
  recording evidence alongside LLM outputs so callers can persist
  rationale and citations without bespoke serialisers (#1158).

### Fixed

- **KIMI direct API aligned with `KIMI_API_KEY` only.** The provider
  previously fell back across several env var candidates, so setting
  the wrong one silently routed traffic to the default key. Routing is
  now keyed exclusively on `KIMI_API_KEY` (#1159).
- **kimi CLI session reuse matched to actual CLI contract.** Session
  IDs are threaded through follow-up turns instead of being dropped
  after the first turn (#1157).
- **HTTP MCP reconnect state preserved across transport restarts** —
  the client no longer loses its resume token when the underlying
  socket is replaced (#1156).

## [0.170.4] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed

- **`llm_provider` parses usage fields from kimi-cli JSONL output.**
  Token counts now surface on KIMI CLI responses; previously
  `prompt_tokens` and `completion_tokens` were dropped (#1155).

### Changed

- **MCP fixture names genericised in transport tests** so new
  providers can reuse the harness without name collisions (#1154).

## [0.170.3] - 2026-04-22

### Added

- **Native timeout handling for `Agent.run`.** Uses Eio's clock
  primitives instead of callback-based workarounds, so timeouts
  compose with the surrounding switch (#1006, #1150).
- **Structured replay metadata in checkpoints.** Replay flows persist
  a typed payload instead of free-form strings, enabling downstream
  tooling to reason about replay provenance (#1149).
- **Structured `network_error_kind` on `NetworkError`.** The
  `llm_provider` error surface classifies transport failures
  (DNS / connect / read / idle) so callers can pick a retry policy
  without string-matching error messages (#1147).

### Fixed

- **HTTP client drains response body to prevent CLOSE\_WAIT
  accumulation.** Long-lived cascades had been leaking sockets into
  CLOSE\_WAIT, eventually exhausting the local port pool (#965,
  #1148).
- **Pipeline message constructor drift resolved** — stages no longer
  produce messages that downstream stages cannot decode after the
  6-stage split (#1151).

### Changed

- **Pipeline split by stage (prepare / route / retry).** `pipeline.ml`
  was broken up along the three stages that were already documented in
  the architecture notes, reducing module size and clarifying
  responsibilities (#1146, #1152).

## [0.170.2] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed

- **Raw trace generation now flushes gracefully on timeout.** When the
  surrounding operation cancelled, the trace backend used to lose its
  in-flight buffer because shutdown raced with cancellation; a typed
  flush hook now drains before the backend tears down (#1141).

## [0.170.1] - 2026-04-22

### Added

- **`NotFound` variant on `api_error` for HTTP 404.** Callers can now
  distinguish 404 from generic HTTP failures without string-matching
  the status code inside error messages (#1139).

### Changed

- **`Otel_tracer` span records made immutable** so they are safe to
  share across Eio fibers without an owning-fiber lock (#1138).

### Fixed

- **Streamed telemetry populated via non-HTTP transports.** Previously
  only HTTP-backed streams emitted telemetry; CLI and in-process
  transports now produce the same span shape (#1140).

## [0.170.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added

- **Tiered recall prompt assembly and budgeting.** Agents can now carry optional typed `tiered_memory = { long_term; mid_term; short_term }` through `Agent.options` and `Builder.with_tiered_memory`. Turn preparation renders a pinned synthetic User recall block after leading system messages, keeps a fixed `LONG -> MID -> SHORT` order, and omits blank tiers (#1133).

### Changed

- **Context reduction and compaction now account for pinned recall tokens.** Reducers reserve the recall token budget before trimming raw history, and proactive/emergency compaction watermarks are computed from `raw history + recall` while only stored raw messages are compacted (#1133).

### Notes

- **Registry coverage now fails loudly when `Provider_kind` and the provider registry drift.** Added a dedicated regression test asserting every `Provider_kind` resolves to a registered entry, closing a silent coverage gap in the provider registry surface (#1132).

## [0.169.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added

- **Typed `Provider_kind` sum type, hoisted to its own module.** `Llm_provider.Provider_kind.t` now lives in a standalone compilation unit (`lib/llm_provider/provider_kind.ml`) so it can be shared by records in `Types` without creating a dependency cycle with `Provider_config`. `Provider_config` re-exports the type via manifest rebinding (`type provider_kind = Provider_kind.t = | Anthropic | ... | Kimi | ...`) so every existing `Provider_config.Anthropic` / `Provider_config.string_of_provider_kind` caller keeps compiling unchanged (#1122).

- **`Provider_kind.of_string` canonical parser.** Accepts the canonical lowercase forms emitted by `to_string` plus the documented legacy aliases (`claude → Anthropic`, `openai → OpenAI_compat`, `llama → Ollama`). Case-insensitive; leading/trailing whitespace trimmed. Returns `None` for unknown inputs so callers fail fast instead of silently defaulting to a wrong provider (#1122).

- **Hand-written `Provider_kind.pp` / `show` / `to_yojson` / `of_yojson`.** Preserve the existing lowercase wire format (`"anthropic"`, not `"Anthropic"`) so records embedding the variant (`Types.inference_telemetry.provider_kind`) can use derived yojson without breaking on-disk or over-the-wire payloads (#1122).

- **`Provider_kind.all : t list` and `Provider_kind.default_api_key_env : t -> string option`** (re-exported as `Provider_config.all_provider_kinds` and `Provider_config.default_api_key_env`). `all` is the canonical enumeration used by tests, CLI completion, and future QCheck generators; `default_api_key_env` centralizes the per-kind env-var convention (`Anthropic → Some "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"`, …). `Provider.default_api_key_env_of_kind` now delegates through the sum type (#1126).

- **Kimi Code provider support.** Added `Kimi` (direct Anthropic-compatible `/v1/messages`) and `Kimi_cli` (subprocess transport via `kimi --print`) variants plus their transports, capabilities, and registry entries (#1125).

### Changed

- **`Types.inference_telemetry.provider_kind` is now `Provider_kind.t option`** (was `string option`). Wire format unchanged — the derived yojson transits through the hand-written `Provider_kind.{to,of}_yojson` so every record serializes the same lowercase strings (`"ollama"`, `"anthropic"`, `"openai_compat"`, …). Existing readers that pattern-matched on the string literal (`Some "ollama"`) move to constructors (`Some Provider_config.Ollama`) at the two callsites in `Complete.complete_cascade` (#1122).

- **`agent_config.resolve_provider` now dispatches on `Provider_kind.of_string`** instead of an ad-hoc `match provider_str with | "anthropic" | ... | _ -> ...` ladder. Closes three drift bugs reported in the tick-6 audit: the SDK-emitted `"openai_compat"` string now resolves to OpenAICompat (was dropping to a broken registry fallback), the documented `"claude"` alias routes to Anthropic, and parsing is case-insensitive (#1123).

- **`Provider_bridge.resolve_auto_model_id` takes `Provider_kind.t` directly**, not a stringified `provider_name`. Removes the dead `"openai"` / `"openrouter"` branches (unreachable from the prior stringify path) and makes future variant additions fail loudly in the compiler rather than silently falling into a wildcard (#1124).

### Notes

- Tests: 44/44 in `test_provider_config` (+13 over 0.164.0 covering parser, serializers, enumeration, and wire-format regressions), 31+4 in the newly-registered `test_agent_config_deep` (was silently unregistered in `test/dune` before #1123), full `@test/runtest` green.

## [0.164.0] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed

- **Codex CLI transport honors request model IDs.** `transport_codex_cli` now passes a non-empty, non-`auto` `Provider_config.model_id` through `codex exec --model`, matching Claude Code and Gemini CLI behavior while preserving `auto` as "use the user's CLI default".
- **ApprovalRequired fallback no longer emits an operator-facing WARN without a callback.** The existing fail-open behavior is unchanged, but `agent_tools` now records the fallback at debug level so consumers do not see an unactionable warning on every approval-less tool execution.

### Added

- **`Hooks.on_idle_escalated` adds runtime-computed idle severity.** Callers can opt into a structured idle hook carrying `nudge` / `final_warning` / `skip` severity while keeping the legacy `on_idle` path for compatibility. `skip_at` reuses `max_idle_turns`; `final_at` is configurable per agent via `idle_final_warning_at`.
- **Tool error retry classification now honors explicit runtime error classes.** `Types.tool_error` carries an optional typed `error_class`, and `Tool_retry_policy.decide` now prefers that explicit classification over legacy `failure_kind` inference. Recoverable errors marked `Deterministic` no longer blind-retry.

### Changed

- **`response_format` now uses a typed variant surface** for agent config, builders, provider config, and checkpoints: `Off | JsonMode | JsonSchema of Yojson.Safe.t` (issue #957). `Builder.with_response_format_json`, `Provider_config.make ?response_format_json`, and checkpoint decoding of legacy `response_format_json: bool` remain as compatibility shims. In this step, provider request builders honor `JsonMode`; `JsonSchema _` is preserved through config/persistence but not yet emitted as provider-native schema parameters.

- **Completion contract violations now carry typed contract IDs.** `Error.CompletionContractViolation.contract` now uses `Completion_contract_id.t` instead of `string`. `Agent_sdk.Completion_contract` and `Agent_sdk.Completion_contract_id` are re-exported; downstream code that serialized the old string field should switch to `Completion_contract_id.to_string`.

### Notes

- **Version boundary realigned for downstream pins.** `main` now advertises `0.164.0` so post-`0.163.0` public API growth no longer masquerades as the earlier `0.163.0` floor used by downstream SHA pins and compatibility checks.

## [0.163.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- **`Hooks.Nudge` accepted from `before_turn`.** Previously only `OnIdle` could return `Nudge`; `before_turn` returning `Nudge` was silently dropped by the pipeline (`stage_input` only handled `ElicitInput`). The decision matrix and `legal_decisions_for_stage` now list `K_Nudge` for `before_turn`, and `pipeline.ml stage_input` appends the nudge text as a User-role message before tool preparation so it reaches the model in the same turn. Mirrors the `on_idle` Nudge handler at `pipeline.ml:392`. Generic primitive — payload is opaque text, no domain knowledge in OAS.

## [0.162.0] - 2026-04-19

### Added

- **`Event_bus` envelopes carry `caused_by`.** `envelope.caused_by : string option` links every event back to the originating run. Three emitters wire it through: `orchestrator` (`AgentStarted` → `AgentCompleted`/`AgentFailed`, PR #1019), `agent` handoff (`HandoffRequested` → `HandoffCompleted`, PR #1020), `agent_tools` (`ToolCalled` → `ToolCompleted`, PR #1021). Enables causation tracing across a single run without re-parsing agent logs.
- **`Tool_retry_policy.error_class` variant** (PR #1027). Contract-first typed classification of tool errors drives retry decisions; replaces string-based pattern matching at callsites.
- **`Agent_turn.idle_granularity` opt-in variant** (PR #1024). Fine-grained `is_idle` reporting for callers that need sub-turn idle signals without changing the default coarse-grained behavior.
- **Inference profile exposes `top_p` / `top_k` / `min_p`** (PR #1015). Constants-layer extension so cascade configs can pin sampling parameters without provider-specific escapes.

### Fixed

- **CLI transports disable MCP by default in headless mode** (PR #999). `transport_claude_code` / `transport_codex_cli` / `transport_gemini_cli` stop inheriting user MCP config for non-interactive invocations unless explicitly opted in via `OAS_*_ALLOWED_MCP`. Eliminates the "connection refused to dead MCP port" noise observed in keeper logs.
- **`Hooks.OnToolError` emitted on tool execution failure** (PR #1031). Prior behavior left callers relying on `stop_reason` heuristics; now the failure path fires a dedicated hook with the error payload.
- **`Hooks.OnError` emitted on tool-not-found dispatch failure** (PR #1035 — deferred, see PR description).
- **`llm_provider` honors `~cwd` at the OS level** via `env -C <dir>` prefix (PR #1016). Earlier implementation relied on the CLI's own `--cwd` flag, which was inconsistent across providers and silently dropped by some wrappers.

### Changed

- **`LLM_ENDPOINTS` parsing unified** via `Discovery.parse_llm_endpoints_env` (PR #1014). Transports and discovery now share a single comma-split + trim routine.

### Chore

- **Test registry cleanup.** Six orphan tests wired into `test/dune` — `test_agent_config` (#1030), `test_agent_turn_budget_unit` (#1026), `test_agent_tool` (#1033), `test_agent_typed` (#1034), `test_agent_pipeline` (#1036), `test_agent_lifecycle` (#1037). No behavior change; tests were previously not run.

## [0.161.0] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed

- **`transport_gemini_cli.build_args` no longer emits `--system-prompt`.** Gemini CLI (>=0.38) rejects the flag with `Unknown arguments: system-prompt` and the subprocess exits with code 1, so any cascade member using `gemini_cli:auto` with a system prompt was failing every turn. System text is now folded into the `-p` argument as labelled `[System]` / `[User]` blocks via the new `effective_prompt` helper, which keeps the role distinction without requiring a CLI flag. `None` / empty system prompts pass through unchanged, so the argv for prompt-only callers is byte-identical to pre-0.161.0.

## [0.160.1] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed

- **Completion contract no longer rejects no-ToolUse responses when the model was cut off mid-turn.** `completion_contract.validate_response` now treats `stop_reason = MaxTokens` or `Unknown "pause_turn"` as resumable for `Require_tool_use` / `Require_specific_tool`, so callers can continue the turn (or raise `max_tokens`) instead of seeing a spurious `CompletionContractViolation`. Observed on Anthropic Haiku 4.5 where extended thinking consumes the 8192-token output budget before a ToolUse block emits and the API returns `pause_turn`. `EndTurn`, `StopToolUse`, `StopSequence`, and unknown reasons other than `pause_turn` continue to reject no-ToolUse responses (PR #1001).

## [0.160.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- **Event bus backpressure policy + stats + purpose labels** (PR #998).

## [0.159.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- **Historical env-driven CLI flag experiment.** Non-interactive CLI transports briefly accepted transport-specific env aliases at `build_args` time. Those aliases are retired; current callers should use explicit transport config records and current provider/model env keys.
- `lib/llm_provider/cli_common_env.{ml,mli}` centralises env parsing (`get`, `bool`, `list`, `kv_pairs`) so the three transports agree on truthy values and splitting rules.

### Notes

- Gemini CLI has no runtime flag to disable hooks — hook lifecycle remains governed by the `gemini hooks` subcommand, outside transport scope.
- Codex CLI exposes no dedicated `--no-mcp` / `--no-hooks` flags; every toggle there flows through `-c key=value` TOML overrides.

## [0.157.1] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed

- **TLS EOFs now stay on the retryable network-error path.** `llm_provider/http_client.ml` now maps `End_of_file` and `Sys_error` into `NetworkError`, so transient peer-close / socket-teardown failures no longer escape as top-level worker exceptions and instead flow through the existing retry/cascade logic (PR #995).
- **OpenAI-compatible sampling defaults now respect model capability records.** `apply_sampling_defaults` no longer auto-injects `min_p=0.05` for Gemini/GLM-style OpenAI-compatible models that advertise `supports_min_p = false`, which removes the warn-and-drop path while preserving the existing default for Qwen-class and unknown localhost endpoints.

## [0.155.1] - 2026-04-17

### Changed

- **OAS telemetry now stays inside the OAS boundary.** Provider fallback observability was removed from the public metrics/Event_bus surface so OAS remains a single-provider runtime and orchestration policy stays outside the SDK.
- **Runtime telemetry preserves raw-trace linkage and anomaly detail structurally.** Runtime participant events now carry `raw_trace_run_id`, `stop_reason`, `completion_anomaly`, and `failure_cause`, and sessions publish a `runtime-raw-trace-json` artifact so external consumers can correlate runtime state with raw traces without reverse-parsing free-form strings.

## [0.154.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- **`Content_replacement_event_bridge`.** Observer-only wrappers around `Content_replacement_state.record_replacement` / `record_kept` that publish `Custom("content_replacement_frozen", ...)` after successful state mutation, with an explicit `action` discriminator and `seen_count_after` payload (PR #982).
- **`Hooks.PostCompact` + `hooks.post_compact`.** Observer-only post-compaction lifecycle surface fired after successful proactive and emergency compaction, preserving the existing Event_bus behavior while exposing the reduced message set to hook consumers (PR #985).

### Fixed

- **Direct API dispatch now patches latency telemetry.** `Api.create_message` measures wall-clock request time on the non-cascade path and overwrites the parser-layer `request_latency_ms = 0` sentinel, so responses created through `Pipeline.stage_route -> Api.create_message` report real latency instead of zeros (PR #972).

### Removed (operator-facing)

- **`oas-review` CLI binary (`bin/review_agent.ml`).** Operator/example tool, not part of the SDK runtime contract. The same agent is still buildable from the example tree via `dune exec examples/review_agent.exe -- <owner/repo> <pr_number>` for anyone who wants the script. Audit reference: `docs/_audit/2026-04-17-coordination-leak-candidates.md` (PR #978).
- **`oas-autonomy-smoke` CLI binary (`bin/autonomy_smoke_cli.ml`).** Operator-facing diagnostics that wrapped `Autonomy_trace_analyzer` to compare divergence across runs. The underlying library module `Autonomy_trace_analyzer` remains exported through `Agent_sdk.Autonomy_trace_analyzer`; downstream consumers that want the same diagnostic loop can call the library directly instead of relying on the CLI. Audit reference: same file as above.

Net effect: the `agent_sdk` opam package no longer publishes `oas-review` or `oas-autonomy-smoke` binaries. `oas` and `oas-runtime` are unchanged. The `lib/` API surface is unchanged.

## [0.155.0] - 2026-04-17

Verification tests + real-world examples for the v0.154.0 event surface.

### Added

- **`test/test_event_integration.ml`** — end-to-end assertions that
  the new variants actually emit where they should:
  - Orchestrator error path publishes `AgentFailed` alongside
    `AgentCompleted(Error _)`.
  - `Agent.run_with_handoffs` emits `HandoffRequested` then
    `HandoffCompleted` in order, with the sub-prompt in `reason`.
  - `Hooks.invoke` dispatches `OnContextCompacted` payloads correctly
    and `Hooks.empty.on_context_compacted` defaults to `None`.
- **`test/test_multivendor_live.ml`** — live smoke test that drives
  the golden transcript against every reachable provider
  (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini via OpenAI-compat, and any
  OpenAI-compatible local endpoint discovered via `LLM_ENDPOINTS`:
  llama-server, Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio, TGI, …). Each case skips
  gracefully when its prerequisite is missing, so CI without
  credentials stays green. Verifies Invariants I1/I2
  (provider-agnostic native variants, envelope preservation) against
  real providers rather than mocks only.
- **`examples/agent_failure_observability.ml`** — subscribes to an
  Event_bus and drives an orchestrator failure path so the
  `AgentFailed` payload (`agent_name`, `task_id`, `error`, `elapsed`)
  is visible at runtime. No LLM / network required.
- **`examples/handoff_lifecycle.ml`** — two-agent handoff with an
  inline mock OpenAI-compatible server; prints the
  `HandoffRequested` → `HandoffCompleted` lifecycle so the `reason`
  and `elapsed` fields are self-documenting.

### Changed

- **`test_orchestrator.ml::test_event_bus_receives_completed`**
  no longer assumes `AgentCompleted` is the last event — since
  v0.154.0 the companion `AgentFailed` follows it on error paths,
  so the test now looks events up by payload shape and also
  asserts the `AgentFailed` companion is emitted.

## [0.154.0] - 2026-04-17

Event system cleanup + boundary enforcement.

### Added

- **`Event_bus.AgentFailed`** payload variant. Emitted alongside
  `AgentCompleted` whenever a task ends with `Error`. Subscribers that
  want to match on failure directly no longer need to destructure the
  `result` Result.t. Provider-agnostic.
- **`Event_bus.HandoffRequested`** and **`HandoffCompleted`** payload
  variants. Emitted at the sub-agent run bracket inside
  `Agent.run_with_handoffs`. Mirrors OpenAI Agents SDK
  `handoff_requested` / `handoff_occurred`. Provider-agnostic.
- **`Hooks.OnContextCompacted`** hook event + `on_context_compacted`
  field on the `hooks` record. Fires at the same call sites as
  `Event_bus.ContextCompacted`. Use this hook for audit / metrics;
  Event_bus remains for async observation.
- **`Journal_bridge.make`** now accepts `?correlation_id` and `?run_id`
  so journal events bridged onto `Event_bus` share the same envelope as
  the surrounding agent run.
- **`docs/EVENT-CATALOG.md`** single source of truth for every event
  surface (Event_bus, Hooks, Durable journal, Runtime protocol, LLM
  wire stream, A2A), reserved Custom namespaces, multi-vendor matrix,
  and the Hook vs Event decision matrix.
- **`test/test_multivendor_events.ml`** asserts Event_bus taxonomy
  invariants (envelope preservation, event_type_name stability, golden
  lifecycle transcript) that every provider must honor.

### Changed (Breaking)

- **Runtime events decomposed per variant.** Previously all 13
  `Runtime.event_kind` variants flattened into one
  `Custom("runtime.event", json)`; now each gets its own name:
  `runtime.session_started`, `runtime.turn_recorded`,
  `runtime.agent_became_live`, …, `runtime.session_failed`. Subscribers
  can filter by topic without JSON parsing. The stdout
  `Event_message` protocol write is unchanged (primary transport).
- **Durable Custom names normalized colon → dot.**
  `durable:turn_started` → `durable.turn_started` (8 names). Matches
  runtime and provider namespace convention.
- **`Event_bus.TaskStateChanged` removed.** Dead variant from
  v0.31–0.35 A2A roadmap — declared but never emitted, no consumers.
  The SSE-only `A2a_server.task_event` is a separate, unrelated type
  and is unaffected.
- **`Journal_bridge.make` signature** changed from
  `bus:Event_bus.t -> Durable_event.event -> unit` to
  `bus:Event_bus.t -> ?correlation_id:string -> ?run_id:string ->
   unit -> (Durable_event.event -> unit)`. Call sites: add `()`.
- **`Hooks.hooks` record** gains `on_context_compacted` field; `empty`
  and `compose` updated. Pattern matches on `Hooks.hook_event` must add
  an `OnContextCompacted` arm.
- **`Event_bus.payload` pattern matches** must add arms for the four
  new variants (`AgentFailed`, `HandoffRequested`, `HandoffCompleted`)
  and drop the `TaskStateChanged` arm.

### Refactored

- `eval_collector.ml` replaces `_ -> ()` wildcard with explicit arms
  per payload variant so future variants don't silently drop.

### Migration for downstream consumers

The only known consumer (masc-mcp) subscribes to native Event_bus
variants via explicit arms; expect compile errors against v0.154.0 for:
- new variants (add arms for `AgentFailed`, `HandoffRequested`,
  `HandoffCompleted`)
- removed variant (delete `TaskStateChanged` arm)
- `Hooks.hooks` record field addition
- `Journal_bridge.make` signature

See `docs/EVENT-CATALOG.md` for the full taxonomy and boundary
guidance.

## [0.153.1] - 2026-04-17

### Changed

- **Documentation alignment with code reality.** README rewritten so the architecture diagram, provider table, scope-limitations table, and version statement reflect what is actually wired in `lib/` and `lib_swarm/`. The literal version string has been removed from the README; `lib/sdk_version.ml` is the only source of truth (PR #976).
- **SDK boundary tightened: OAS docs no longer name any specific downstream coordinator.** Comment in `lib/agent/agent_types.ml`, `docs/sdk-independence-principle.md`, RFCs, and supporting docs were generalized to "downstream consumer" / "external coordinator". The OAS-vs-named-coordinator analysis at `docs/design/cascade-boundary-analysis.md` was moved to `docs/archive/2026-04/` (PR #976). `CHANGELOG.md` itself is intentionally untouched in that PR — it is a historical record.
- **Personal-project disclaimer added at the top of README.** Makes the no-SLA / no-support posture explicit (PR #976).
- **Repo hygiene.** `TODO.md` removed from tracking; `.gitignore` broadened to absorb common operator-local scratch (`_build_*/`, one-off `*.py`, ad-hoc analysis `.md`) so future drops don't slip into commits (PR #977).
- **Audit tracker added.** `docs/_audit/2026-04-17-coordination-leak-candidates.md` records the read-only sweep of `lib/`, `lib_swarm/`, `bin/`, and RFCs for coordination-layer leaks. Four low-risk candidates documented; structure otherwise clean (PR #978).

No code or API changes. Bump captures the documentation/hygiene cycle as a tagged release boundary.
## [0.153.0] - 2026-04-17

### Changed

**`Budget_strategy.default_summarizer` is now exported in `budget_strategy.mli`.** Previously it was only used internally as the fallback for `strategies_for_phase` and `reduce_for_budget` when no custom `summarizer` was supplied. With the 0.152.0 addition of `Agent.options.summarizer`, downstream consumers writing wrapper summarizers had to re-implement the extractive default byte-for-byte to preserve the `[Summary of N earlier messages]` shape. Exporting lets them delegate instead.

Signature: `val default_summarizer : Types.message list -> string`. No behavior change; this is strictly an API surface addition.

3 new tests in `test_budget_strategy.ml`: empty → `[No prior context]` marker, header + role prefix shape, per-message truncation at 100 chars.

## [0.152.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added

**`Agent_types.options.summarizer : (message list -> string) option`.** Exposes the Budget_strategy Emergency-phase summarizer callback as a per-agent option so downstream consumers can inject a domain-aware summary function. When `None` (default), the built-in `Budget_strategy.default_summarizer` is used and behavior is unchanged.

- `Builder.with_summarizer` setter registers a custom callback.
- `pipeline.ml` (`proactive_compact` + `emergency_compact`) threads `?summarizer:agent.options.summarizer` into `Budget_strategy.reduce_for_budget`.
- The existing `?summarizer` optional parameter on `Budget_strategy.reduce_for_budget` is unchanged; it is simply now reachable from `Agent.options`.

Motivation: consumers may need application-specific summary semantics before messages are re-injected as compacted history. Previously the only customization path was post-hoc transformation via `context_reducer`, which runs **after** `reduce_for_budget` — by that point the `[Summary of N earlier messages]` string is already materialized. Exposing the summarizer on `Agent.options` makes that boundary explicit while keeping OAS domain-agnostic.

PR #973.

## [0.151.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added

**`Anthropic cache_extended_ttl` field.** Opt-in 1-hour prompt cache TTL for Anthropic Messages API callers. When `cache_extended_ttl = true`, cache control blocks are stamped with the extended-beta TTL instead of the default 5-minute window.

PR #962.

## [0.150.0] - 2026-04-16

### Removed (breaking, operator-facing)

**`OAS_OLLAMA_SUPPORTS_TOOL_CHOICE` env var deleted.** The process-wide env knob coupled deployment config to library semantics: a single boolean forced every Ollama-served model into the same `supports_tool_choice` setting, and the SDK silently matched on the runtime environment instead of the caller's declared config. Consumers that want a model-specific override now declare it per-call; see Added below.

Deleted:
- `Capabilities.parse_ollama_supports_tool_choice_env` (`lib/llm_provider/capabilities.ml`)
- `Capabilities.ollama_supports_tool_choice_default` (module-init env read)
- 12 inline `%test` cases exercising the env parser
- `ollama_capabilities.supports_tool_choice` is now hardcoded `false`; the documented Qwen3.5+Jinja opt-in path is through the new `supports_tool_choice_override` field.

### Added

**`Provider_config.supports_tool_choice_override : bool option`.** Lets the caller declare per-config whether their model honors `tool_choice:required`. `None` falls through to the per-kind default in `Capabilities` and the per-model override in `Capabilities.for_model_id`. `Some b` wins over both.

Rationale: keeps the SDK model-agnostic. The SDK no longer matches on `model_id` substrings ("qwen") to guess model-side behavior — the consumer (e.g. a cascade loader that knows it deployed Qwen3.5 with the Jinja chat template) declares the fact on each `Provider_config.t`.

Consumed by `backend_openai.build_request`: when `supports_tool_choice_override = Some b`, `b` is used instead of the capability record to decide whether the `tool_choice` body field is sent.

### Migration

- Callers that set `OAS_OLLAMA_SUPPORTS_TOOL_CHOICE=1` in deployment: drop the env var, pass `~supports_tool_choice_override:true` to `Provider_config.make` instead (or declare it in your cascade config and thread it through).
- Callers that did not set the env var: no behavioral change (default was already `false`).

## [0.148.0] - 2026-04-15

### Removed (breaking)

**Legacy cascade API fully evicted.** 0.146.0 removed `lib/llm_provider/cascade_*` modules but the older primary+fallbacks cascade API remained (Api/Retry/Provider/Builder/Agent layers). This release deletes it too, making OAS unambiguously single-provider.

Deleted:
- `type Provider.cascade` + `Provider.cascade` constructor (`lib/provider.ml/.mli`)
- `Api.create_message_cascade` (`lib/api.ml/.mli`)
- `Retry.with_cascade` (`lib/llm_provider/retry.ml/.mli`)
- `Builder.with_cascade`, `Builder.with_fallback` (`lib/agent/builder.ml/.mli`)
- `options.cascade` field on agent options (`lib/agent/agent_types.ml/.mli`, `lib/agent/agent.mli`)
- `cascade` field on `Agent_card.agent_info` + cascade_providers export (`lib/protocol/agent_card.ml/.mli`)
- `Pipeline.stage_route` cascade branch (now always `Api.create_message` single-provider)
- Tests: cascade cases in `test_deep_coverage.ml`, `test_e2e_v024.ml`, `test_bug_hunt.ml`, `test_provider.ml`, `test_builder_coverage.ml`
- Example: `examples/custom_provider.ml` (cascade demo) + `examples/dune` stanza

### Migration

Callers that relied on `Builder.with_cascade` / `Builder.with_fallback`:
1. Implement your own cascade loop around `Agent.run` / `Api.create_message`, OR
2. Use MASC's `lib/cascade/` if you're building in the MASC ecosystem.

Canonical pattern (MASC `oas_worker_named.ml` `try_cascade`):
```ocaml
let rec try_cascade remaining last_err =
  match remaining with
  | [] -> Error (format_exhausted_error last_err)
  | provider :: rest ->
    match Agent.run_with_provider agent ~provider with
    | Ok r -> Ok r
    | Error e when should_retry e -> try_cascade rest (Some e)
    | Error e -> Error e
```

### Rationale

Two parallel cascade systems existed in OAS: the `cascade.json`-based FSM (removed in 0.146.0) and this legacy primary+fallbacks record. Both are orchestration responsibilities, not SDK responsibilities. The SDK is now a pure `Provider_config.t → api_response` function.

## [0.146.0] - 2026-04-15

### Removed (breaking)

**Cascade completely evicted from OAS.** OAS is now a pure single-provider SDK.

Deleted modules (lib/llm_provider/):
- `cascade_config.ml` + `.mli` — parser/resolver utilities
- `cascade_config_loader.ml` + `.mli` — cascade.json hot-reload
- `cascade_fsm.ml` + `.mli` — pure decision FSM
- `cascade_health_filter.ml` — error classification
- `cascade_health_tracker.ml` + `.mli` — provider success/fail + cooldown
- `cascade_model_resolve.ml` + `.mli` — glm:auto alias resolution
- `cascade_throttle.ml` + `.mli` — local endpoint slot table

Deleted tests:
- `test/test_cascade.ml`, `test_cascade_config.ml`, `test_cascade_config_ext.ml`, `test_cascade_deep.ml`

Deleted example:
- `examples/cascade_failover.ml`

### Internal

- `Provider_bridge.resolve_auto_model_id` inlined (was delegating to `Cascade_model_resolve`)
- `Provider_bridge.resolve_glm_model_id`, `resolve_glm_coding_model_id` inlined (direct `Zai_catalog` calls)
- Stale docstring references (`{!Cascade_config}`) left in `constants.ml`, `provider_registry.mli`, `provider.ml`/`.mli` — to be purged in follow-up cleanup

### Migration

Cascade ownership moved to MASC (masc-mcp#7382 scaffold + #7386 migrate).
Consumers previously using `Llm_provider.Cascade_*` should:
1. Implement their own cascade loop around `Complete.complete`, OR
2. Use MASC's `lib/cascade/` modules (import MASC's masc_cascade or replicate the pattern)

Reference: MASC `oas_worker_named.ml` `try_cascade` function shows the canonical single-provider-loop pattern.

### Rationale

Cascade is an orchestrator responsibility, not an SDK responsibility. OAS was accumulating orchestration code (FSM, health tracking, throttle tables, weighted selection) that tightly coupled the SDK to MASC's operational model. Extracting cascade to MASC lets OAS focus on one job: "give me a Provider_config.t, I'll call it and return the response."

## [0.144.0] - 2026-04-15

### Removed (breaking)

- `Cascade_executor` module deleted (839 lines). Zero remaining callers
  after Judge and Tool_selector migrated to single-provider in 0.142.0
  and 0.143.0. Callers that need multi-provider failover drive their
  own loop around `Complete.complete` (MASC's `oas_worker_named.ml`
  `try_cascade` is the reference pattern).

### Internal

- Stale docstring references to `Cascade_executor` removed from
  `Context_reducer`, `Text_estimate`, and `test_complete_http`.

Note: `Cascade_config`, `Cascade_fsm`, `Cascade_health_tracker`,
`Cascade_health_filter`, `Cascade_throttle`, `Cascade_model_resolve`
remain for this release — they are SDK utilities that MASC still
consumes directly. A follow-up PR moves them into MASC and removes
them from OAS entirely (MAJOR bump).

## [0.143.0] - 2026-04-15

### Changed (breaking)

- `Tool_selector.default_rerank_fn` now takes `~provider:Provider_config.t`
  instead of `~cascade_name`, `~defaults`, `?config_path`, `?clock`. OAS
  no longer resolves cascade.json inside the rerank closure — callers
  that want multi-provider failover pick a single `Provider_config.t`
  per rerank (MASC selects from `cascade.json` and passes the winner).
- Implementation: replaces 4-step cascade resolve + `Cascade_executor.
  complete_cascade_with_accept` with a direct `Complete.complete` call.
  Rerank still overrides sampling (temperature 0.0, max_tokens 200) for
  deterministic, short replies. BM25 fallback on LLM failure unchanged.

### Migration

Before:
```ocaml
let rerank = Tool_selector.default_rerank_fn
  ~sw ~net ~cascade_name:"tool_selector"
  ~defaults:["llama:auto"] ~k:5 ()
```

After:
```ocaml
(* Caller resolves one provider from whatever source and passes it in. *)
let provider = (* ... *) in
let rerank = Tool_selector.default_rerank_fn
  ~sw ~net ~provider ~k:5 ()
```

Rationale: cascade is MASC's responsibility. OAS is a single-provider SDK.

## [0.142.0] - 2026-04-15

### Changed (breaking)

- `Judge.judge` now takes `~provider:Provider_config.t` instead of
  resolving a named cascade internally. OAS no longer owns cascade
  orchestration — callers that want multi-provider failover pick a
  single `Provider_config.t` per call (MASC selects from `cascade.json`
  and passes the winner).
- `Judge.judge_config` dropped `cascade_name` and `max_turns` fields.
  `max_turns` was dead (single-turn evaluation is the only mode);
  `cascade_name` belongs in the orchestrator, not in OAS.
- `Judge.judge` dropped `?clock` and `?config_path` parameters.
  Single-provider calls do not retry with backoff and do not read
  `cascade.json`.

### Migration

Before:
```ocaml
let cfg = { Judge.default_config () with cascade_name = "my-judge" } in
Judge.judge ~sw ~net ?clock ?config_path ~config:cfg ~context ()
```

After:
```ocaml
(* Caller resolves one provider from whatever source (cascade.json,
   a static value, etc.) and passes it in. *)
let provider = (* ... *) in
let cfg = Judge.default_config () in
Judge.judge ~sw ~net ~provider ~config:cfg ~context ()
```

Rationale: cascade is MASC's responsibility. OAS is a single-provider SDK.

## [0.140.0] - 2026-04-15

### Removed (breaking)

- `Cascade_config.complete_named`, `Cascade_config.complete_named_stream` —
  the named-cascade convenience wrappers. Callers should compose the
  primitives directly:
    1. `Cascade_config.resolve_model_strings` (config lookup + defaults)
    2. `Cascade_config.expand_model_strings_for_execution`
    3. `Cascade_config.parse_model_strings`
    4. `Cascade_config.filter_healthy`
    5. `Cascade_executor.complete_cascade_with_accept` (or `_stream`)
  In-tree consumers `judge.ml` (oas#925) and `tool_selector.ml` (oas#926)
  were migrated to this pattern in the previous two releases.
- `Cascade_config.complete_cascade_with_accept`,
  `Cascade_config.complete_cascade_stream` re-export shims — call
  `Cascade_executor.complete_cascade_with_accept` /
  `Cascade_executor.complete_cascade_stream` directly.
- `Cascade_config.filter_healthy_internal` private helper — only callers
  were the deleted wrappers above. Public `Cascade_config.filter_healthy`
  is unchanged.

### Migration

```ocaml
(* Before: *)
Cascade_config.complete_named ~sw ~net ?clock ?config_path
  ~name ~defaults ~messages ~temperature ~max_tokens ()

(* After: *)
let model_strings =
  Cascade_config.resolve_model_strings ?config_path ~name ~defaults ()
  |> Cascade_config.expand_model_strings_for_execution
in
let providers =
  Cascade_config.parse_model_strings ~temperature ~max_tokens model_strings
in
let healthy = Cascade_config.filter_healthy ~sw ~net providers in
Cascade_executor.complete_cascade_with_accept ~sw ~net ?clock
  ~accept:(fun _ -> Ok ()) healthy ~messages ~tools:[]
```

## [0.139.0] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- `Cascade_config.resolve_model_strings_with_trace` — structured selection
  trace for cascade decisions. Returns the ordered model list plus a
  `selection_trace` with per-candidate `config_weight`, `effective_weight`,
  `success_rate`, and `in_cooldown`. Enables dashboards/telemetry to
  surface *why* a provider was chosen first without re-deriving state.
- `Cascade_health_tracker.provider_info` / `all_providers` — structured
  snapshot API for the rolling-window health tracker. Returns
  `provider_info` records (key, success rate, consecutive failures,
  cooldown state + expiry, events in window). Complements the existing
  string-based `provider_summary`.

### Notes
- No breaking changes. Existing consumers of `resolve_model_strings_traced`
  and `provider_summary` are unaffected.

## [0.138.0] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- `Context_reducer` now strips orphaned `ToolResult` blocks before the API
  call so compacted contexts do not trip `tool_call_id` validation on
  OpenAI-compatible providers (#917).
- `Utf8_sanitize` strips disallowed control characters to prevent
  downstream JSON serialization faults (#916).

## [0.137.0] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- Weighted cascade routing for named/default profiles:
  - `cascade.json` model arrays now accept `{ "model", "weight" }` entries.
  - First-attempt provider selection uses weighted random ordering while
    preserving deterministic fallback priority.
  - Health-aware weight adjustment and cooldown-aware filtering feed the
    effective provider order before execution (#911).

### Fixed
- Anthropic response parsing now initializes telemetry placeholders
  consistently with the other provider backends (#912).
- OpenAI-compatible request builders strip orphaned `ToolResult` blocks
  before serialization so compacted contexts no longer trip invalid
  `tool_call_id` errors on GLM/Groq/DeepSeek paths (#914).

## [0.136.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- `Event_bus.ContextOverflowImminent` payload — proactive warning emitted
  before context overflow occurs, with `estimated_tokens`, `limit_tokens`,
  and `ratio` fields (#901).
- `Event_bus.ContextCompactStarted` payload — marks compaction start with
  a `trigger` field (`proactive`, `emergency`, or `operator`) (#901).
- `Context_reducer.estimate_next_turn_overhead` — estimates fixed overhead
  (system prompt + tool descriptions + output reserve) for budget projection
  before the next turn (#901).
- `Cascade_executor.truncate_to_context_strict` — strict variant of
  `truncate_to_context` that returns `Error (\`Over_budget (est, budget))`
  instead of silently passing over-budget content. Original function
  unchanged for backward compatibility (#901).

## [0.135.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- `Agent.save_journal t path` — thin wrapper over
  {!Durable_event.save_to_file}. Returns `Error "no journal"` when the
  agent has no journal attached (#894).
- `Builder.with_auto_dump_journal ~path` — installs an
  `on_run_complete` callback that dumps the journal on every run
  completion. Creates a fresh journal if one is not attached so the
  dump is never empty (#894).

## [0.134.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- `Durable_event` JSONL persistence primitives:
  `save_to_file` (atomic tmp+rename) and `load_from_file`
  (missing → empty journal, malformed → line-numbered error) (#892).

### Changed
- Version bump to 0.134.0 after integrating the full Durable_event
  journal stack from 0.133.0.

## [0.133.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- `Durable_event` integration across agent runtime (#890, #891):
  - `agent_types.options.journal` field + `Builder.with_journal`.
  - `pipeline.ml` appends `Turn_started`, `State_transition`,
    `Llm_request`, `Llm_response`, `Error_occurred`,
    `Checkpoint_saved` (proactive + emergency).
  - `agent_tools.ml` appends `Tool_called` / `Tool_completed` with
    idempotency keys suitable for replay deduplication.
- `Durable_event.create ?on_append` fan-out callback (#891).
- `Journal_bridge.make ~bus` projects every journal event onto
  `Event_bus.Custom ("durable:<kind>", payload)` — Event_bus
  subscribers observe the full journal stream without payload
  schema changes (#891).

## [0.132.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- `Diag` module in `llm_provider` — pluggable structured diagnostic logging
  with level filtering and consumer-replaceable sink. Replaces 27 raw
  `Printf.eprintf` calls across 6 files.

## [0.131.0] - 2026-04-13

### Removed
- `Provider.local_qwen`, `Provider.local_mlx` deprecated aliases.
- `vote` type, `vote_request`, `Vote` command, `Vote_recorded` event
  (dead code: projection ignored votes, field never populated).
- `"local-qwen"` provider resolver string alias.
- `session.votes` field from runtime session record.

### Added
- Diagnostic logging in `cascade_health_filter.ml` for provider
  filtering decisions (API key drops, cloud-only fallback).

## [0.126.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- `Context_reducer.cap_message_tokens` strategy to cap per-message token
  budgets while preserving recent turns and inserting a truncation marker
  when the middle is dropped.
- Swiss Verdict JSON schema v1 at `docs/schemas/swiss-verdict.schema.json`.
- `Harness.verdict_to_json`, `Harness.swiss_verdict_to_json`, and
  `Eval.run_metrics_to_json` for schema-aligned evaluation export.

### Changed
- Checkpoint delta metrics now use the `oas.checkpoint.*` namespace instead
  of flat `checkpoint_delta_*` names.

## [0.125.0] - 2026-04-13

### Removed
- `Api.named_cascade` type, constructor, `create_message_named`,
  `create_message_named_stream`, and `Builder.with_named_cascade`.
  Cascade FSM moved to MASC in Phase 2; this removes the dead OAS residue.
- `config/cascade.json` — cascade config is now MASC-owned SSOT.
- `Agent.t.named_cascade` field and `?named_cascade` parameter from
  `Agent.create` and `Agent.resume`.

### Changed
- `Tool_selector.default_rerank_fn`: replaced `~named_cascade` parameter
  with explicit `~cascade_name`, `~defaults`, and `?config_path`.

## [0.122.1] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- Anthropic: Messages API conformance — tool_choice nesting + thinking gate (#835)

### Changed
- Extract canonical CJK-aware text estimator to llm_provider (#829)
- Drop dead Gemini/GLM exception catches in create_message (#836)
- Add n > 0 guard to effective_max_context (#826)

## [0.122.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added
- Capabilities: OAS_OLLAMA_SUPPORTS_TOOL_CHOICE env override (#801)
- Cascade: per-entry api_key_env override in cascade config (#817)
- Agent: emit per-turn timing line to stderr for budget diagnosis (#816)

- Pipeline: remove per-LLM-request Eio.traceln spam for Unspecified priority default (#799)
- Cascade: apply per-model timeout to last provider (#805)

### Changed
- Discovery: drop the model-specific local URL fallback; use `OAS_LOCAL_LLM_URL` for local runtime overrides (#818)

## [0.121.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- Multi-vendor inference providers: Groq, DeepSeek, Alibaba, SiliconFlow (#789)
- Process-wide global registry for Metrics.t (#807)

- Retry: flat-error-string extraction (#795)

## [0.118.1] - 2026-04-09

### Changed
- `oas-review` now reports the shared SDK version instead of a stale hardcoded `0.46.0` string.
- `swarm_plan_cache` mode decoding now uses explicit `result` handling instead of exception-driven control flow while preserving legacy serialized mode names.

## [0.117.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- Runtime `glm:auto` expansion now yields ordered GLM execution fallbacks for named completions, streaming completions, and local capacity selection. Closes #738.
- `glm:auto` now expands to a multi-model GLM cascade during config/model resolution instead of a single default model. Closes #736.

### Changed
- `Constants.Inference_profile.agent_default` and `worker_default` now use `max_tokens = 16_384`; endpoint docs also clarify that port `8085` is the llama.cpp default. Closes #737.

### Fixed
- OpenAI-compatible requests now send explicit `Content-Length` headers to avoid chunked-encoding rejection by strict upstreams. Closes #735.
- `backend_openai` omits `tool_choice` for models that do not advertise tool-choice support, preserving backward compatibility for unknown models. Closes #725.
- Legacy tool parameter lists are normalized into JSON Schema before OpenAI-compatible/Ollama tool serialization. Closes #734.
- `complete_http` adds pre-flight JSON-body validation and richer 4xx diagnostics for malformed provider payloads. Closes #726.
- Cascade diagnostic logs now quote field values and gate debug output behind `OAS_CASCADE_DIAG`. Closes #724.
- Retry follow-up cleanup tightened wording, allocation behavior, and inline coverage around `retry.ml`. Closes #723.

## [0.111.0] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- `ollama` provider in cascade registry. `ollama:auto` routes to Ollama MLX
  server at `OLLAMA_HOST` or `http://127.0.0.1:11434`. Always available (no
  API key required). OpenAI-compatible endpoint, 262k max context.

## [0.110.0] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- `Agent.make_extend_turns_tool` with public `Agent.t` type for runtime turn extension. Closes #674.
- Slot pinning for llama-server KV cache reuse via `slot_id` parameter in sync and streaming paths. Closes #672.
- Per-model timeout for non-last cascade providers (default 1200s). Closes #679.
- End-to-end test proving context_injector to LLM delivery chain. Closes #673.

### Fixed
- 4 design debt items from boundary audit: removed stale references, aligned provider abstractions. Closes #667, #668, #669, #670.
- Preserve `Context.t` identity in `context_with_contract` to prevent hooks from reading empty data on resume. Closes #676.
- Sync `model_endpoints` before cascade parsing so `endpoint_for_model` can route `llama:model_id` correctly. Closes #677.

## [0.109.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- 17 new tool descriptor mappings for HITL (`ask_user_question`), web (`web_fetch`, `web_search`), task management (`task_create/update/list/get/output/stop`), team (`team_create/delete`), browser interaction (`navigate`, `computer`, `find`, `form_input`, `javascript_tool`, `tabs_create_mcp`, `upload_image`), and notebook (`notebook_read`). Addresses #646.
- Inline tests for `Mode_enforcer.builtin_descriptor` and `Mcp_schema.descriptor_for_builtin_tool`.

## [0.108.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- `max_turns` field in `BeforeTurnParams` hook event. Consumers can compute remaining turns without duplicating max_turns tracking. Closes #658.

## [0.107.0] - 2026-04-06

### Changed
- A2A `message_part_to_yojson` outputs v1.0 Part shape with `type` discriminator field. Text: `{"type":"text","text":"..."}`. File: nested `{"type":"file","file":{...}}` with `bytes`/`uri`. Data: `{"type":"data","data":{...}}`. Legacy format parsing preserved in `of_yojson`. Closes #591.

## [0.106.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- `Constants.Inference_profile.worker_default` (temp=0.2, max_tokens=4096) and `deterministic` (temp=0.0, max_tokens=4096) inference profiles for downstream coordinators.
- `Budget_strategy.context_metrics` type and constructor — aggregates usage ratio, compression phase, and limit proximity into a single value.
- Lifecycle transition guards (A2A pattern): `Lifecycle.validate_transition` enforces valid state machine transitions.
- Collaboration and Plan transition guards with typed error reporting.

## [0.105.0] - 2026-04-06

### Changed
- Consolidated hardcoded endpoint URLs (`http://127.0.0.1:8085`, `http://localhost:8085`) into `Constants.Endpoints` module. All production and test code references the SSOT constants instead of string literals. Prevents port drift across files (prior art: #557).
- `Constants.Anthropic.prompt_cache_min_chars` extracts the prompt caching threshold (3500 chars) from `backend_anthropic.ml`.
- `provider.ml` local URL detection replaced magic number 16 with `String.length`-based prefix check.
## [0.104.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- `Mode_enforcer.builtin_descriptor` derives `Tool.descriptor` from the builtin registry. Read-only tools get `Parallel_read`, mutation tools get `Sequential_workspace`, shell/external tools get `Exclusive_external`. Consumers can query descriptors for built-in tools without hardcoding.
- `agent_tools.concurrency_class_of_tool` now falls back to `builtin_descriptor` when a tool has no attached descriptor, enabling correct parallelization of read-only built-in tools.

## [0.102.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- `Agent_types.options.priority` field (`Request_priority.t option`). Enables the resume path to set scheduling priority without requiring a full `agent_config` override. When set, overrides `config.priority` on the resumed agent. Builder path already uses `Builder.with_priority`.

### Fixed
- Resume path no longer defaults to `Unspecified` priority when the caller intends a specific scheduling class (fixes #616).

## [0.101.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- `Tool_index.entry.aliases` field for additional BM25 tokens (e.g. Korean keywords). Aliases are appended to name+description during tokenization. Existing code using `{ name; description; group }` must add `aliases = []`.
- `TopK_bm25.confidence_threshold` parameter. When the top BM25 score falls below this threshold, `fallback_tools` are unioned with the results. `None` disables fallback. Distinct from `Tool_index.config.min_score` which filters individual documents.
- `TopK_bm25.fallback_tools` parameter for curated tool subsets to include on low-confidence queries.

### Changed
- `Tool_index.entry` record now requires `aliases` field (source-breaking for direct record construction).
- **BREAKING**: `TopK_llm` variant now uses `rerank_fn` closure instead of `selector_config`. The stub (`failwith "Phase 3"`) has been replaced with a working 2-stage implementation: BM25 pre-filter then LLM reranking via caller-injected closure.
- `TopK_llm` strategy: `select` may perform I/O via `rerank_fn`. Not idempotent for this strategy. `always_include` provides deterministic lower bound.
- `default_rerank_fn` provided for `Cascade_config`-based LLM reranking. Captures Eio resources in closure.

## [0.100.7] - 2026-04-04

### Added
- Shared inference-contract helpers in `Provider` for provider/model/modality/task resolution without forcing existing `model_spec` callers to migrate.
- `Context_overflow` CDAL result status for infra-level provider errors.

### Fixed
- Internal tool retry policy now preserves non-recoverable failures and clamps invalid retry counts before retry scheduling.

## [0.100.6] - 2026-04-04

### Added
- `PolicyChannel` for lazy tool policy propagation to spawned agents.

### Fixed
- Removed MASC-specific tool names from `tool_index` test fixtures to keep OAS boundary tests SDK-local.

## [0.100.5] - 2026-04-04

### Added
- `Response_harness` for deterministic text and tool-output extraction from model responses.
- Real A2A HTTP binding with `tasks/sendSubscribe` SSE streaming.
- `Inference_profile` as the single source of truth for inference defaults.
- `Tool_index` scoped retrieval and rebuild APIs for dynamic tool-set updates.
- Hook-level `system_prompt_override`, policy decision lineage, and a fail-closed decision validity matrix.

### Changed
- `Agent_tools` now treats `Exclusive_external` tool batches as a barrier-separated execution class.
- CDAL mode enforcement uses descriptor-driven classification instead of hardcoded heuristics.
- Turn pipeline now prunes in-memory tool results and enforces a message cap between turns.

### Fixed
- Hook tool-filter overrides are intersected with operator policy instead of widening access.
- Discovery now reports actual Ollama context size, and SDK-facing surfaces no longer leak MASC-specific references.

## [0.100.3] - 2026-04-04

### Added
- Cascade slot-full fallthrough for load distribution across providers.

### Changed
- Local endpoint defaults are consolidated behind `Discovery.default_endpoint`.
- HTTP mock servers in tests now use ephemeral ports instead of fixed allocations.

### Fixed
- Capability filtering fails closed on unknown limits instead of silently allowing them.
- Runtime rejects unknown provider names instead of coercing them to `Local`.
- Pricing distinguishes unknown models from genuinely free providers.
- Eio cancellation and runtime mutex handling were hardened around shutdown paths.

## [0.100.2] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- Tool execution scheduling metadata is now recorded in raw traces and CDAL proof-store tool traces.

### Changed
- `Hooks.PreToolUse`, `Hooks.PostToolUse`, and `Hooks.PostToolUseFailure` now carry `tool_use_id` plus deterministic schedule metadata.
- `Raw_trace.Tool_execution_started` records `planned_index`, `batch_index`, `batch_size`, and `concurrency_class`.

## [0.100.1] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- `Tool.concurrency_class` metadata for explicit tool execution contracts.

### Changed
- `Agent_tools.execute_tools` now schedules `Parallel_read` tools in parallel batches and runs workspace or external tools sequentially.
- Tools without declared concurrency metadata now default to conservative sequential execution.

## [0.99.8] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- Turn-level slot yielding for swarm efficiency (#538).
- Explicit permit API for turn-level slot yielding (#536).
- Custom tokenizer support for BM25 tool index (#540).
- OpenAI `auto` model resolution in cascade config (#541).

### Changed
- `Log` module globals use `Atomic.t` for data-race-free reads (#543).

## [0.99.7] - 2026-03-31

### Changed
- Remove 586 lines of redundant inline tests from `memory.ml` (821 → 209 lines). Covered by alcotest suites.
- Remove 8 dead re-exports and 1 internal-only function that were only consumed by the removed inline tests.

## [0.99.6] - 2026-03-31

### Changed
- Extract `Cascade_health_filter` and `Cascade_executor` from `cascade_config.ml` (983 → 721 lines). No public API changes.

## [0.99.5] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed
- Cascade no longer tries remaining providers on local resource exhaustion (EADDRNOTAVAIL, EMFILE, ENOBUFS). Saves wasted connection attempts when ephemeral ports or FDs are depleted.

## [0.99.4] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed
- Deduplicated `env_or` in `cascade_model_resolve.ml` (2 inline closures → 1 module-level function).
- Replace O(n) structural list comparison with O(1) counter check at loop exit.

## [0.99.3] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed
- Consolidated duplicate `Sys.getenv_opt` patterns in `review_agent.ml` and `mcp.ml` to use `Defaults` helpers.

## [0.99.2] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- `Defaults.int_env_or` / `Defaults.float_env_or` — typed env var helpers for int and float values.
- `OAS_MCP_HTTP_URL` env var — configurable MCP HTTP default endpoint.
- `OAS_REVIEW_MODEL` env var — configurable review agent model selection.
- `OAS_AGENT_MAX_RETRIES`, `OAS_AGENT_INITIAL_DELAY`, `OAS_AGENT_MAX_DELAY` env vars — configurable swarm retry policy.

### Fixed
- Periodic callback exceptions now logged via `Printf.eprintf` instead of silently swallowed.
- Fatal exceptions (`Out_of_memory`, `Stack_overflow`, `Sys.Break`) re-raised in periodic callbacks.

## [0.99.1] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- `Swarm_plan_cache` module — convergence trajectory caching and warm-start for swarm runs (#508).
  - `structural_fingerprint` — deterministic hash of config structure (agents, roles, mode, convergence params).
  - `template_of_state` — captures quality signals and per-agent scores from converged runs.
  - `hints_of_template` / `apply_hints` — tighter iteration bounds and agent reordering (Decentralized only).
  - `make_recording_callbacks` — opt-in integration via `on_converged` callback composition.
  - `fs_backend` — filesystem-backed cache with atomic writes.
- `Swarm_plan_cache.agent_score_to_json` / `agent_score_of_json` — public score serialization.
- `Checkpoint` delta support (#498) — `compute_delta` / `apply_delta` with full restore fallback.
- `Stub_tool_results` reducer strategy for observation masking (#500).
- Swarm checkpoint fidelity gate — `converged` flag preserved in checkpoint v2 (#499, #505).

### Fixed
- `Custom_role` JSON roundtrip — strip inner quotes from `ppx_deriving.show` output (#508).
- GLM default base URL changed to `api.z.ai` (#501).
- Provider mock token counts made explicit (#507).

## [0.98.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- `Slot_scheduler.snapshot` — non-blocking point-in-time capacity snapshot.
- `Slot_scheduler.try_with_permit` — non-blocking slot acquisition returning `'a option`.
- `Provider_throttle.capacity_source` type — `Discovered | Fallback` discriminator.
- `Provider_throttle.source`, `snapshot`, `try_permit`, `queue_length`, `max_concurrent` getters.
- `Cascade_throttle.capacity_info` type with `process_*` prefix for process-scoped counts.
- `Cascade_throttle.capacity` — single-endpoint capacity query.
- `Cascade_config.local_capacity_for_selections` — cascade-selection-scoped capacity query with cold start probe via `~sw ~net`.

### Changed
- `Provider_throttle.of_discovery_status` now tags result with `source = Discovered`.
- `Cascade_throttle.populate` promotes Fallback entries to Discovered when probe returns slot data.

## [0.97.0] - 2026-03-30

## [0.96.0] - 2026-03-30

- `Slot_scheduler` module — priority-aware slot scheduling with Eio.Mutex + Eio.Promise (#483).
- `Provider_throttle.with_permit_priority` — priority-aware permit acquisition.
- `Unspecified` variant in `Request_priority` — logs warning, dispatched as Proactive.
- `Request_priority.resolve` — resolves Unspecified to Proactive with warning.
- `priority` field in `Types.agent_config` — flows through Agent.run pipeline to cascade throttle.
- `?priority` parameter in `Api.create_message_named` and `create_message_named_stream`.

### Changed
- `Provider_throttle` now uses `Slot_scheduler` internally instead of `Eio.Semaphore`.
- Higher priority requests (Interactive) are dequeued before lower priority (Background) when slots are full.

## [0.95.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- `Request_priority` module — `Interactive | Proactive | Background` priority type for LLM completion scheduling (#478).
- `?priority` parameter added to all completion and cascade functions.
- `to_yojson`/`of_yojson` converters for `Request_priority`.

### Changed
- `complete_stream_cascade` now correctly threads `?priority` through to `complete_stream`.

## [0.94.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added
- Add `Swarm_types.agent_entry.extensions` so downstream consumers can attach explicit pass-through metadata to swarm entries.
- Add read-side `Proof_store` APIs for artifact ref resolution, JSON/JSONL reads, manifest/contract loading, and run listing.
- Annotate all 186 `.mli` files with explicit stability tiers and document the tier policy in `docs/api-stability.md`.

### Changed
- Move GitHub Actions off Node 20 by upgrading `actions/checkout` to `v5` and `actions/upload-artifact` to `v6`.

### Fixed
- Replace MASC-specific coordination keywords in `Context_intent` with coordinator-agnostic generic terms.
- Make `Fs_result.ensure_dir` recursive as documented and reject proof-store artifact refs with traversal-style `run_id` values.

## [0.93.1] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed
- Refactor swarm convergence bookkeeping into explicit state transitions so Eio async control flow no longer depends on ad-hoc `ref` accumulators.
- Make streaming mailbox draining cooperative and replace swarm round-robin selection's global `ref` counter with `Atomic.t`.

## [0.92.2] - 2026-03-27

### Changed
- Raise `mcp_protocol`, `mcp_protocol_eio`, and `mcp_protocol_http` minimum versions to `>= 1.0.0`, and pin CI's `mcp-protocol-sdk` checkout to the 1.0.1 SHA.

### Fixed

## [0.92.1] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- Improve HTTP client error context for hostname/TLS setup failures and preserve `Eio.Cancel.Cancelled` during socket cleanup.
- Build MCP tool-result test fixtures via JSON parsing so local newer MCP SDK pins and CI's older schema both pass.

## [0.92.0] - 2026-03-26

### Changed
- `Swarm_types.metric_source` now uses `Argv_command of string list` for process metrics, and `Runner.eval_metric` executes argv directly via `Eio.Process.parse_out`.
  Migration: replace `Shell_command "cmd --flag value"` with `Argv_command ["cmd"; "--flag"; "value"]`.

### Fixed
- `scripts/release.sh` now validates version consistency against `lib/sdk_version.ml` and `agent_sdk.opam`, matching the current version single-source-of-truth layout.

## [0.91.2] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- Guard `Fiber.fork` bodies against exception leaks in resilience paths.
- Widen `cohttp-eio` 6.2 connect return typing and sync version metadata.

- `eval_baseline.load` used failwith instead of direct Result return.
- `succession.metrics_of_json` inconsistent float parsing (try-with to to_float_option).

## [0.89.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- **Reflexion module** (`Reflexion`): act-evaluate-reflect-retry loop primitive based on MAR (Multi-Agent Reflexion) pattern. Separated concerns: Act/Diagnose/Critique/Aggregate. Integrates with Episodic memory for reflection persistence. `Reflexion.run` executes the loop, `format_reflection` formats failed verdicts, `on_stop_evaluator` wraps as hook adapter. 11 tests.
- **Clear_tool_results strategy** (`Context_reducer`): replaces processed tool results in older turns with short markers, preserving tool_use_id for API consistency. Safest and lightest form of context compaction (Anthropic recommendation).
- **PreCompact hook event** (`Hooks`): new lifecycle event emitted before context compression. Carries `messages`, `estimated_tokens`, and `budget_tokens` for pre-compaction intervention.
- `pre_compact` field in `Hooks.hooks` record.
- **Tool_index module** (`Tool_index`): pure OCaml BM25 implementation for dynamic tool exposure. Indexes tool descriptions at startup, retrieves top-K relevant tools per query. Confidence gate for automatic fallback. Group co-retrieval. 8 inline tests.
- **Retrieval_based strategy** (`Progressive_tools`): BM25-indexed tool retrieval per turn context. Extracts query from last user message. Falls back to full catalog below confidence threshold. `always_include` for essential tools.
- **Durable_event module** (`Durable_event`): event-sourced agent loop journal. 9 event types (Turn_started, Llm_request/response, Tool_called/completed, State_transition, Heartbeat, Checkpoint_saved, Error_occurred). Idempotency keys for replay-safe tool execution. Heartbeat lease detection. Replay summary for crash recovery. Full JSON round-trip. 14 tests.

## [0.78.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- `max_context` field in `Provider_registry.entry` — default context window size per provider.
- Usage helpers in `Types`: `zero_api_usage`, `usage_of_response`.
- `cc` (Claude Code) provider integrated into `reg` pattern with `max_context:200_000`.

## [0.77.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- **Plan module** (`Plan`): goal decomposition into ordered steps with dependency DAG. Step lifecycle (Pending/Running/Done/Failed/Skipped), re-planning, progress tracking, JSON serialization. Complementary to Durable (Plan = what to do, Durable = how to execute reliably). 20 tests.
- `examples/plan_execute_demo.ml`: 4 scenarios (linear deployment, re-planning after failure, serialization, dependency graph).

### Design decisions
- Norm module deferred to MASC. Norms are inter-agent (social), not intra-agent. Principle: "agent itself = OAS, MASC = consumer".

## [0.76.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- **Governance layer**: runtime governance for agent decisions.
  - `Policy`: priority-ordered rule evaluation at 6 decision points (BeforeToolCall, BeforeHandoff, BeforeResponse, ResourceRequest, BeforeMemoryWrite, Custom) with 4 verdicts (Allow, Deny, AllowWithCondition, Escalate). 11 tests.
  - `Audit`: immutable log of policy decisions with capacity eviction, query filters, JSON export. 11 tests.
  - `Durable`: typed step chains with execution journal for crash recovery. Execute/resume/suspend with retry. JSON round-trip. 20 tests.
- `test_governance_integration.ml`: 9 integration tests (Policy+Audit, Durable+Audit, full governance flow).

- `Fs_result`: Result-based filesystem operations replacing scattered try/with patterns.
- `Memory_tools`: agent-facing memory store/recall/forget tools.
- `Verified_output`: phantom-typed compile-time output verification (`unverified`/`verified` type tags).
- `Memory_access`: deny-by-default agent-scoped permission layer (prefix-based key patterns).
- Gemini native backend: `contents/parts` wire format, `thinkingConfig`, `functionCall/Response`, SSE streaming. 30 tests.
- Inline tests via `ppx_inline_test` for 13 modules.

### Changed
- 5 files migrated to `Fs_result`, removing 143 lines of duplicated I/O.
- `Thread.create` replaced with `Eio.Fiber.fork` in runtime server.
- `Digest.string` replaced with stable hash; 18 bare catch-all patterns eliminated.

## [0.75.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- **5-tier Memory**: Episodic (time-decaying salience, interaction history) and Procedural (pattern matching, success/failure tracking with confidence) memory tiers added to the existing Scratchpad/Working/Long_term model. 17 new tests.
- **.mli 100% coverage**: All 133 modules now have API contract files (.mli). 49 new .mli files across 6 PRs. Dead code discovered and removed during the process.
- **Coverage 83%**: 44 new test files covering structured output, runtime_client, transport, API, MCP, streaming, orchestrator, swarm, and more.

### Changed

- `Memory.tier` variant extended with `Episodic` and `Procedural`.
- `eval_collector.ml`: removed unnecessary `mutable` on `start_time` field.

## [0.71.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- `.mli` API contracts for 13 modules: runtime_projection, transport, a2a_task, mcp, conformance, direct_evidence, runtime_server, runtime_store, runtime_evidence, agent_config, otel_tracer, streaming, internal_query_engine. Total .mli coverage: 61 -> 74/128 (48% -> 58%).
- Stream accumulator tests (23 cases): `create_stream_acc`, `accumulate_event`, `finalize_stream_acc`, `map_http_error`.
- Coverage tests for cache, pipeline, streaming, structured modules.

### Changed
- **Exception handling**: 16 catch-all `| exn ->` patterns narrowed to specific types across 10 files. `async_agent.ml` now re-raises `Out_of_memory`/`Stack_overflow`/`Sys.Break` (bug fix).

## [0.70.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- `.mli` API contracts for 5 core modules: `harness.mli` (170L), `context_reducer.mli` (71L), `eval.mli` (126L), `checkpoint.mli` (62L), `session.mli` (51L). Total .mli count: 56 -> 61.

- **Capability Filter** (`Capability_filter`): composable predicates for capability-aware provider selection. `requires_tools`, `requires_streaming`, `requires_reasoning`, `requires_all`/`requires_any` combinators.

## [0.68.1] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- **Guardrails_async**: fix Eio cancellation swallowing — `try ... with _ -> ()` replaced with dedicated `Eio.Switch.run`. Removed unused `~sw` parameter from `run_input`/`run_output`/`guarded` (breaking API change, pre-v1.0).
- **Builder**: add `max_cost_usd >= 0.0` validation in `build_safe`. Negative budget no longer silently triggers `CostBudgetExceeded`.

### Added
- `runtime.mli`: public API contract for wire protocol types. Documents collaboration field migration to `Collaboration.t`. (v0.66 formalization)

## [0.68.0] - 2026-03-19

## [0.65.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- **Working memory** (`Memory`): 3-tier facade over `Context.t`. Scratchpad (per-turn), Working (cross-turn), Long_term (external callback). `store`/`recall`/`forget`/`promote`. Fallback recall across tiers. (#v0.65)

## [0.62.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- **Cost tracker** (`Cost_tracker`): USD budget enforcement via `agent_config.max_cost_usd`. `check_budget` returns `CostBudgetExceeded` when exceeded. Structured `cost_report` with per-call averages.
- **Context offload** (`Context_offload`): large tool results (>threshold) written to filesystem, replaced with path + preview. Fail-open: on write failure, original content preserved.
- `Error.CostBudgetExceeded` agent error variant with `spent_usd`/`limit_usd` fields.
- `Builder.with_max_cost_usd` for chainable agent configuration.
- `agent_config.max_cost_usd: float option` field.

### Changed
- `Agent.run_loop` now checks cost budget alongside token budget before each turn.

## [0.61.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- `agent_config.initial_messages`: seed agent conversations with prior history on first run. (#214)
- **Streaming cascade** (`Complete.complete_stream_cascade`, `Cascade_config.complete_named_stream`): multi-provider streaming with failover. Failover on connection/HTTP errors before stream starts; committed once SSE begins. No mid-stream resume, no caching.

## [0.60.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- **MCP HTTP transport**: unified `Mcp.managed` type with `transport` variant (Stdio | Http). JSON config auto-detects via `"url"` key. (#209)

### Changed
- `provider.ml`: `supports_native_streaming` enabled for `openai_chat_capabilities`. (#122)
- Ollama Chat redirects to `/v1/chat/completions` for SSE compatibility. (#122)

## [0.43.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- Structured A2A errors: `A2a of a2a_error` ADT replaces `A2a of string`. 5 typed variants: `TaskNotFound`, `InvalidTransition`, `MessageSendFailed`, `ProtocolError`, `StoreCapacityExceeded`. (#118)
- Instance-based OTel tracer: each `create`/`create_eio` returns independent tracer with own span stack, preventing misattribution in concurrent agents. (#118)
- `Tool_set` module: O(1) tool lookup wired into agent core. (#114)
- `Provider_intf`: `supports_streaming` wired into pipeline Route. (#114)

- v0.37: MCP HTTP transport (`mcp_http.ml`) + SSE parser (`sse_parser.ml`) — JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP
- v0.38: Agent Registry (`agent_registry.ml`) — Hashtbl-based registry with capability lookup
- v0.39: Approval Pipeline (`approval.ml`) — composable multi-step approval evaluation
- v0.40: SDK CLI (`bin/oas_cli.ml`) + Agent Config (`agent_config.ml`) — cmdliner-based CLI entry point
- 7 new test suites (69 tests, 1,183 LOC)
- Error types: `HttpTransportFailed`, `DiscoveryFailed`

### Changed

- Export missing `[@@deriving yojson, show]` in `agent_sdk.mli`

## [0.28.0] - 2026-03-16

- Provider registry E2E integration tests
- Extracted module tests (`api_dispatch`, `api_ollama`)

## [0.26.0] - 2026-03-16

### Changed
- **agent.ml split** (944→671 lines, 29% reduction): Extracted `Agent_lifecycle` and `Agent_checkpoint` modules. (#90)
- **Unified sync/streaming turns**: `run_turn_core` with `api_strategy` parameter replaces duplicated turn functions (~170 lines dedup). (#90)
- **CI coverage gate**: 65% threshold enforced. (#90)

### Fixed
- **MCP race condition**: `next_id` in `Mcp.send_request` protected by `Eio.Mutex`. (#90)

### Added
- **Provider pricing**: OpenAI (gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4.1, o3-mini) and local models (ollama/qwen/llama = 0.0). (#90)
- **MCP health/reconnect**: `Mcp.is_alive`, `Mcp.reconnect`, `Mcp.connect_all_best_effort`. (#90)
- **Transport status**: `Transport.status` query. (#90)

- **test_api_dispatch**: 10 dispatch tests. **test_property_advanced**: 20 QCheck property tests. (#90)
- **docs/custom-providers.md**: vLLM example guide. (#90)

## [0.25.1] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- **Error classification**: OpenAI-compatible API errors in response body were classified as `NetworkError` (retryable) instead of `InvalidRequest` (non-retryable). Added `Openai_api_error` exception with correct routing in `Api.create_message`. (#86)
- **Crash on unexpected JSON**: `api_ollama.ml` used `assert false` for unreachable branch, which would crash with `Assert_failure` if triggered. Replaced with descriptive `failwith`. (#86)
- **Silent exception in worker thread**: `runtime_server.ml` raised `Failure` inside `Eio.Switch.run`, losing the error in the worker thread. Changed to `Result` propagation. (#86)

### Added
- **`tool_choice: None_`**: Disables tool use for a turn. Serializes to `{"type":"none"}` (Anthropic) / `"none"` (OpenAI). (#86)
- **`disable_parallel_tool_use`**: Config field to force sequential tool execution. Maps to `tool_choice.disable_parallel_tool_use` (Anthropic) / `parallel_tool_calls: false` (OpenAI). (#86)
- **`yojson` derivation** for `Sessions`, `Raw_trace`, and `Tool` types. (#87)
- **Makefile** with `make test`, `make coverage`, `make clean` targets. (#85)

## [0.25.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **`Agent_turn` module** (new): Common turn logic extracted from `agent.ml`. Provides `prepare_turn`, `accumulate_usage`, `update_idle_detection`, `apply_context_injection`, `check_token_budget`, `make_tool_results`, and `filter_valid_messages`.

### Changed
- **Streaming path feature parity**: `run_turn_stream_with_trace` now includes `BeforeTurnParams` hook, `apply_turn_params`, `extra_system_context`, `tool_filter_override`, and `context_injector`.
- `agent.ml` reduced by ~50 lines through delegation to `Agent_turn`.

### Added (v0.25.0-rc)
- **Test harness framework** (`Harness`): 6-type pluggable verification — Behavioral, Adversarial, Performance, Regression, Swiss Cheese (multi-layer), Composability.
- **Provider mock** (`Provider_mock`): network-free scripted responses with cycling, convenience builders for text/tool_use/thinking responses.
- **Per-turn parameter adjustment** (`Hooks.turn_params`, `BeforeTurnParams`): hooks can adjust temperature, thinking_budget, tool_choice, tool_filter per turn via `AdjustParams` decision. Parameters revert after each API call.
- **Reasoning extraction** (`Hooks.extract_reasoning`): extracts thinking blocks, detects uncertainty markers, identifies tool selection rationale.
- **Dynamic context strategy** (`Context_reducer.Dynamic`): select windowing strategy at runtime based on turn count and message state.
- **Conditional orchestration** (`Orchestrator.conditional_plan`): `Branch`, `Loop`, `Sequence`, `Cond_parallel` with route conditions (`Always`, `ResultOk`, `TextContains`, `And`, `Or`, `Not`).
- **Context scope isolation** (`Context.isolated_scope`): `create_scope` with `propagate_up`/`propagate_down` key control for sub-agent delegation.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Cascade failover** (`Provider.cascade`): multi-provider failover with primary + fallback list. Retry-aware cascade with `Retry.with_cascade`.
- **Idle detection**: fingerprint-based tool call repetition detection. Configurable `max_idle_turns` with `OnIdle` hook event and `IdleDetected` error.
- **Context compaction** (`Context_reducer`): 6 strategies — `Keep_last_n`, `Token_budget`, `Prune_tool_outputs`, `Merge_contiguous`, `Drop_thinking`, `Compose`. Turn-boundary-aware grouping preserves ToolUse/ToolResult pairs.
- **Context injection** (`Hooks.context_injector`): post-tool-execution hook that updates `Context` key-value store and appends extra messages to the conversation.
- **Cost tracking** (`Provider.pricing_for_model`, `Provider.estimate_cost`): per-model pricing with cumulative `estimated_cost_usd` in `usage_stats`.
- `test_bug_hunt.ml`: 7 bug candidate reproduction and fix verification tests.
- `test_e2e_v024.ml`: 5 end-to-end integration scenarios against live local LLM (gated behind `LLAMA_LIVE_TEST=1`).

### Fixed
- **B1 CRITICAL**: `context_injector` exception crashed the tool loop. Wrapped in `try-with`; exceptions are caught and logged silently.
- **B2 HIGH**: `create_message_cascade` with `clock=None` skipped all fallback providers. Fallbacks are now tried sequentially on retryable errors.
- **B3 HIGH**: Injected `extra_messages` could violate role alternation. Added role validation that drops messages creating same-role adjacency.
- **B4 HIGH**: `Token_budget` strategy returned empty message list when budget was smaller than the most recent turn. Added guard that always keeps the last turn.
- **B5 MEDIUM**: Idle detection failed for empty-empty fingerprint comparison (`[] <> []` = false). Changed `last_tool_calls` from `list` to `option` to distinguish "not yet set" from "empty set".
- **B6 MEDIUM**: `Drop_thinking` replaced thinking-only messages with `Text ""`. Changed to drop the entire message instead of inserting empty text.

### Changed
- `Agent.t.last_tool_calls`: internal type changed from `tool_call_fingerprint list` to `tool_call_fingerprint list option` (not in public API).

## [0.23.0] - 2026-03-15

### Breaking
- `Agent.t` is now an abstract type. Direct field access (`agent.state`, `agent.tools`, etc.) is replaced by accessor functions: `Agent.state`, `Agent.lifecycle`, `Agent.tools`, `Agent.context`, `Agent.options`, `Agent.net`.
- `test_add_message` test removed (external mutation of agent state is no longer possible).

### Migration from 0.22.x

`Agent.t` field access must be replaced with accessor functions:

```ocaml
(* Before (0.22.x) *)
let state = agent.state in
let tools = agent.tools in
let ctx = agent.context in

(* After (0.23.0) *)
let state = Agent.state agent in
let tools = Agent.tools agent in
let ctx = Agent.context agent in
```

`Builder.build` still works but emits a deprecation warning. Switch to `build_safe` for validation:

```ocaml
(* Before *)
let agent = Builder.build builder in

(* After *)
match Builder.build_safe builder with
| Ok agent -> (* use agent *)
| Error err -> Printf.eprintf "Config error: %s\n" (Error.to_string err)
```

### Added
- `Agent.state`, `Agent.lifecycle`, `Agent.tools`, `Agent.context`, `Agent.options`, `Agent.net` accessor functions.
- `Builder.build_safe : t -> (Agent.t, Error.sdk_error) result` with validation:
  - `max_turns > 0`
  - `max_tokens > 0`
  - `thinking_budget` requires `enable_thinking = true`
- `Error.InvalidConfig` variant for configuration validation errors.
- CI pipeline: GitHub Actions with OCaml 5.1.x + 5.4.x matrix, bisect_ppx coverage, odoc, version-check.
- `examples/` directory with 6 examples (3 moved from `bin/`, 3 new).
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` with build instructions, code style, PR expectations.
- Module stability tiers in README (Stable / Evolving / Experimental).

### Deprecated
- `Builder.build` -- use `Builder.build_safe` for validated construction.
- `Provider.local_qwen` -- use `Provider.Local` constructor directly.
- `Provider.local_mlx` -- use `Provider.Local` constructor directly.

### Changed
- README restructured for third-party onboarding: Installation, Quickstart, Provider table, stability tiers.
- Demo executables moved from `bin/` to `examples/`.
- Version consistency enforced by CI (dune-project == agent_sdk.ml).

- `Sessions.get_proof_bundle` now carries worker-run oriented summary fields:
  - `worker_runs`
  - `latest_worker_run`
  - `latest_validated_worker_run`
  - `latest_failed_worker_run`
  - `validated_worker_runs`
  - `raw_trace_run_count`
  - `validated_worker_run_count`
  - `trace_capabilities`
- Runtime participants persist `provider` and `model` into session state so worker evidence can be read without reconstructing it from raw records.
- Runtime mock workers now emit a minimal raw trace so dashboard-style consumers can use the same summary/validation surfaces as direct-agent runs.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- Consumer-safe evidence hardening on top of `0.15.0`:
  - `Sessions.get_latest_raw_trace_run`
  - `Sessions.get_raw_trace_summaries`
  - `Sessions.get_raw_trace_validations`
- Proof bundle now carries validated summary shape:
  - `latest_raw_trace_run`
  - `raw_trace_summaries`
  - `raw_trace_validations`
  - `capabilities`

### Changed
- `Raw_trace` can now be created directly under a session-scoped `raw-traces/` directory with `create_for_session`.
- `Sessions.get_proof_bundle` is now sufficient as a summary-first evidence entrypoint for consumers that should avoid raw path parsing by default.
- `Builder.with_raw_trace` and top-level `create_agent ?raw_trace` remain available for direct-agent consumers.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- Session-scoped raw trace evidence surface:
  - `Raw_trace.create_for_session`
  - `Raw_trace.read_runs`
  - `Raw_trace.summarize_run`
  - `Raw_trace.validate_run`
- `Sessions` raw trace getters:
  - `Sessions.get_raw_trace_runs`
  - `Sessions.get_raw_trace_run`
  - `Sessions.get_raw_trace_records`
  - `Sessions.get_raw_trace_summary`
  - `Sessions.validate_raw_trace_run`
- `Builder.with_raw_trace` and optional `raw_trace` support in top-level `create_agent`.

### Changed
- `Sessions.get_proof_bundle` now includes `structured_telemetry` and discovered `raw_trace_runs`.
- Session-scoped direct agent runs can now be discovered and validated without parsing `Checkpoint.messages`.
- Runtime store now reserves a stable `raw-traces/` directory under each session root.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- Append-only agent-level raw trace capability for direct `Agent` runs:
  - `Raw_trace.create`
  - `Raw_trace.read_all`
  - `Raw_trace.read_run`
  - `Agent.last_raw_trace_run`
- `Agent.options.raw_trace` for attaching a JSONL raw trace sink to `run` / `run_stream` / resumed agents.
- Raw trace record types:
  - `run_started`
  - `assistant_block`
  - `tool_execution_started`
  - `tool_execution_finished`
  - `run_finished`

### Changed
- Direct `Agent.run_stream` tool loops can now emit immutable audit traces without changing `Checkpoint`, which remains the latest-state resume mechanism.
- `Builder` now carries the new `Agent.options.raw_trace` field with a default of `None`.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- Structured telemetry schema alongside the legacy string-based telemetry surface:
  - `Sessions.structured_event_count`
  - `Sessions.structured_telemetry_step`
  - `Sessions.structured_telemetry`
  - `Sessions.get_telemetry_structured`
- Telemetry artifacts now include normalized `event_name` counts and per-step structured fields such as actor, role, provider, model, checkpoint label, and outcome.

### Changed
- Telemetry JSON keeps the legacy `kind` and raw `event_counts` output, but now also emits normalized event-name fields for stable downstream verification.
- Runtime tests now validate structured telemetry metadata rather than relying only on `kind` string substring checks.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- Official session proof-bundle read APIs:
  - `Sessions.get_telemetry`
  - `Sessions.get_evidence`
  - `Sessions.get_proof_bundle`
- Typed proof-bundle surface in `Sessions` for telemetry step counts, evidence files, and combined session/report/proof retrieval.

### Changed
- Runtime proof and evidence artifacts can now be consumed through the SDK without relying on raw artifact-name lookups.
- Runtime tests now verify the public proof-bundle getters rather than parsing evidence JSON ad hoc.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- Provider model-spec and capability registry:
  - `Provider.capabilities`
  - `Provider.model_spec`
  - `Provider.capabilities_for_model`
  - `Provider.capabilities_for_config`
  - `Provider.model_spec_of_config`
- Scoped cross-turn state in `Context`:
  - scopes: `App`, `User`, `Session`, `Temp`, `Custom`
  - helpers: `delete`, `snapshot`, `scoped_key`, `get_scoped`, `set_scoped`, `delete_scoped`, `keys_in_scope`, `diff`
- Artifact service and session artifact access:
  - `Artifact_service.list`
  - `Artifact_service.get_text`
  - `Sessions.list_artifacts`
  - `Sessions.get_artifact_text`
- MCP expansion beyond tools:
  - `Mcp.list_resources`
  - `Mcp.read_resource`
  - `Mcp.list_prompts`
  - `Mcp.get_prompt`
- Trace-driven evaluation:
  - `Trace_eval.summarize`
  - `Trace_eval.evaluate`
  - `Trace_eval.evaluate_flushed`
- Runtime evidence bundle generation:
  - telemetry JSON artifact
  - telemetry markdown artifact
  - evidence JSON artifact with persisted file hashes
- `oas_proof_demo` executable for reproducible non-test proof bundles

### Changed
- OpenAI-compatible request shaping is now capability-gated instead of relying on scattered provider/model conditionals.
- Qwen-only request fields (`top_k`, `min_p`, `chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking`) are omitted for generic OpenAI-compatible providers.
- Checkpoints now persist agent context and restore it through `Agent.resume` and `Session.resume_from`.
- Runtime artifact metadata is now first-class:
  - `artifact_id`
  - `mime_type`
  - `size_bytes`
- Runtime proof checks are stronger and deterministic:
  - `terminal_event`
  - `seq_contiguous`
  - `artifact_ids_unique`

### Fixed
- Runtime finalize now persists telemetry/evidence artifacts even after the session has entered a terminal phase.
- MCP output truncation is budget-aware for tool and resource text responses.
- Session-level proof/demo evidence now includes artifact manifests with file sizes and MD5 digests.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- Harness-first runtime layer with bundled `oas-runtime` subprocess, file-backed session journal, report/proof generation, and typed runtime protocol
- High-level `query` / `Client` surface on top of the runtime harness, with low-level `runtime_query` / `Runtime_client` escape hatches
- Session helpers for listing, reading, renaming, and tagging persisted runtime sessions
- `Contract` module for explicit runtime awareness, trigger context, tool grants, MCP allowlists, and skill bundles
- Builder helpers for contract-aware assembly: `with_contract`, `with_skill`, `with_skills`, `with_tool_grants`, `with_mcp_tool_allowlist`
- Long-lived interactive client semantics:
  - partial message surfacing (`Partial_message`)
  - progressive receive (`receive_messages`, `receive_response`, `wait_for_messages`)
  - resume/attach via `session_id` / `resume_session`
  - persisted session settings across reconnects

### Changed
- Default high-level local-first path is now `provider = Some "local-qwen"` and `model = Some "qwen3.5"` for `llama.cpp`-style local runtimes
- Runtime transport now uses a background reader thread to handle response, control, and event envelopes
- `set_model` now persists through runtime session updates instead of mutating SDK-local state only
- Builder now compiles explicit contracts into composed system prompts, filtered local tools, filtered MCP tool surfaces, and reserved context metadata

### Fixed
- Runtime protocol version mismatch is detected during initialize handshake
- Blank protocol lines are ignored on both SDK and runtime sides instead of surfacing as JSON parse failures
- Runtime tests now reflect asynchronous worker completion semantics rather than assuming synchronous spawn completion

## [0.9.1] - 2026-03-11

### Changed (breaking)
- `Types.tool_choice_of_json`: `(_, string) result` → `(_, Error.sdk_error) result`
- `Provider.resolve`: `(_, string) result` → `(_, Error.sdk_error) result`
- `.mli`: `module Retry : sig ... end` and `module Error : sig ... end` → module aliases for type equality

### Fixed
- `Checkpoint.of_json`: removed redundant `Result.map_error` bridge for `tool_choice_of_json` (now returns `sdk_error` directly)
- `Api.create_message`, `Streaming.create_message_stream`: pass through `Provider.resolve` error directly instead of re-wrapping

### Migration
- All SDK functions now return `(_, Error.sdk_error) result` — structured error migration is complete
- `Structured.schema.parse` retains `('a, string) result` (user-provided parser; wrapped to `sdk_error` at boundary)

## [0.9.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- `Error` module: 2-level structured error type hierarchy (`sdk_error`) replacing `(_, string) result` across the SDK
  - 7 domain-specific inner types: `api_error`, `agent_error`, `mcp_error`, `config_error`, `serialization_error`, `io_error`, `orchestration_error`
  - `agent_error.TokenBudgetExceeded` with `{ kind; used; limit }` for structured budget checks
  - `Error.to_string` for human-readable messages, `Error.is_retryable` for retry decisions
  - `Error.api_error` is a type alias for `Retry.api_error` (zero-cost reuse)

### Changed (breaking)
- `api.ml` split into `api_common.ml`, `api_anthropic.ml`, `api_openai.ml`, `api_ollama.ml` — public API (`Api.create_message`) unchanged
- `agent.ml` split: tool execution extracted to `agent_tools.ml`, handoff helpers to `agent_handoff.ml` — public API unchanged
- `Mcp_bridge` module removed from public API — use `Mcp.connect` and `Mcp.to_tools` instead
- 33 function signatures changed from `(_, string) result` to `(_, Error.sdk_error) result` across 14 modules
- `Api.create_message`: no longer flattens `Retry.api_error` to string; returns `Error (Api err)` preserving the structured error
- `Agent.check_token_budget`: returns `Error.sdk_error option` instead of `string option`
- `Streaming.create_message_stream`: returns `Error.sdk_error` with `Config (UnsupportedProvider _)` for non-Anthropic providers
- `Orchestrator.task_result.result`: error type changed from `string` to `Error.sdk_error`
- `Event_bus.AgentCompleted.result`: error type changed from `string` to `Error.sdk_error`
- `Checkpoint_store.create`: `Eio.Fs.dir_ty Eio.Path.t -> t` changed to `-> (t, Error.sdk_error) result`
- `Checkpoint_store.list`: `t -> string list` changed to `-> (string list, Error.sdk_error) result`

### Fixed
- Removed string prefix matching anti-pattern in `agent.ml` (was guessing error types from message text)
- `Api.create_message` no longer discards structured error information from retry layer
- `Checkpoint_store.create`: now returns result instead of silently ignoring `mkdirs` failure
- `Checkpoint_store.list`: now returns result instead of silently returning `[]` on `read_dir` failure
- `Retry.classify_error`: narrowed `with _ ->` to `Yojson.Json_error | Type_error` so non-JSON exceptions propagate

### Migration
- Tool handler interfaces (`Tool.t`) retain `(string, string) result` (user-provided handlers, not SDK errors)
- Use `Error.to_string` where string representation is needed

### Internal
- Test coverage baseline: 63.72% (1491/2340 points, bisect_ppx)

## [0.8.3] - 2026-03-11

### Changed
- `Mcp.t`: removed `mutable tools` field — `list_tools` is now pure, `to_tools` takes explicit `mcp_tool list` argument

### Changed (breaking)
- `Mcp.to_tools`: signature changed from `t -> Tool.t list` to `t -> mcp_tool list -> Tool.t list`

### Added (tests)
- `test_mcp_session.ml`: server_spec roundtrip, JSON serialization with env, reconnect_all empty case
- `test_otel.ml`: in-progress span JSON, flush/reset state, concurrent span creation

## [0.8.1] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- `Event_bus`: replaced raw `lock`/`unlock` with `Eio.Mutex.use_rw ~protect:true` and `use_ro` for exception safety
- `Mcp_session.reconnect_all`: return type now `Mcp.managed list * (info * string) list` to preserve error messages from failed connections
- `Checkpoint.of_json`: malformed `mcp_sessions` (non-array, non-null) now returns `Error` instead of silently defaulting to `[]`
- `test_event_bus.ml`: added missing `Eio_main.run` wrappers to 4 tests that used Eio primitives without a domain context

### Changed (breaking)
- `Mcp_session.reconnect_all`: return type changed from `Mcp.managed list * info list` to `Mcp.managed list * (info * string) list` — callers matching on the second element need to destructure the `(info, error_msg)` pair
- `Event_bus.filter_agent`: `Custom` events now pass through all agent-scoped filters (previously silently dropped because `Custom` had no `agent_name` field)

## [0.8.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- `Agent.clone`: deep-copy agent state with fresh or copied context, shared net/tools/options
- `Context.copy`: shallow-copy context hashtable
- `Structured.extract_stream`: SSE streaming for structured output extraction with schema validation
- `Event_bus`: typed publish/subscribe for agent lifecycle events (Eio.Stream per subscriber)
  - 7 event types: AgentStarted, AgentCompleted, ToolCalled, ToolCompleted, TurnStarted, TurnCompleted, Custom
  - 3 built-in filters: `filter_agent`, `filter_tools_only`, `accept_all`
  - Integrated into Agent.options, Orchestrator.config, Builder.with_event_bus
- `Mcp_session`: persistent MCP session capture/restore for checkpoint/resume cycles
  - `capture`/`capture_all`: serialize server specs and discovered tool schemas
  - `reconnect_all`: re-establish MCP connections from saved info
- `Checkpoint` v1 to v2 migration: added `mcp_sessions` field with backward compatibility
- `Mcp.managed`: added `spec` field to preserve original server_spec for reconnection

### Changed
- Agent: `run_turn`, `run_turn_stream`, `find_and_execute_tool` publish events to event_bus
- Orchestrator: `run_task` publishes AgentStarted/AgentCompleted events
- Version bump: 0.7.1 -> 0.8.0 (27 modules, 584 tests)

## [0.7.1] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- `Otel_tracer`: all mutable span operations (`start_span`, `end_span`, `add_event`, `add_attrs`, `flush`, `reset`) protected with `Stdlib.Mutex`
- `Otel_tracer.start_span`: ID generation moved outside critical section to reduce lock contention

### Changed
- README: architecture table expanded to 25 modules, version synced to 0.7.1
- `Mcp.initialize`, `Mcp_bridge.initialize`: client_version updated to 0.7.1
- CHANGELOG: added `[0.7.0]` section for previously undocumented changes

### Removed
- `Random.self_init()` calls in `Session` and `Otel_tracer` (unnecessary on OCaml 5.x domain-local PRNG)

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- `Agent.resume`: restore agent from a `Checkpoint.t` with messages, usage, turn count, model, and config
- `Session.resume_from`: create a new session linked to a checkpoint's session_id via `resumed_from`
- MCP server lifecycle management: `Mcp.server_spec`, `Mcp.managed`, `Mcp.connect_and_load`, `Mcp.connect_all`, `Mcp.close_all`

### Changed
- MCP client: replaced self-contained implementation with `mcp-protocol-sdk` v0.10.0 wrapper (PR #29)
- `Mcp_bridge`: added Eio-native MCP client bridge module (PR #24)
- Version bump: 0.5.0 -> 0.6.0

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- `Tracing` module: observability via `TRACER` module type with `Null_tracer` (zero-allocation no-op) and `Fmt_tracer` (stderr output)
- `with_span` exception-safe RAII pattern for span lifecycle management
- Agent API calls and tool executions wrapped with tracing spans
- Human-in-the-Loop: `ApprovalRequired` hook decision variant with `approval_callback` type
- `approval_decision` type: `Approve`, `Reject of string`, `Edit of Yojson.Safe.t`
- `Context_reducer` module: message windowing with turn-boundary grouping
- `keep_last` strategy: retain last N turn groups
- `token_budget` strategy: approximate token-based windowing (4-char heuristic)
- `custom` strategy: user-provided `message list -> message list` function
- `group_into_turns`: respects ToolUse/ToolResult pairing constraint
- `find_and_execute_tool` helper: eliminates code duplication in tool execution

### Changed
- `Agent.t` record: added `tracer`, `approval`, `context_reducer` fields (all optional with defaults)
- `hook_decision` type: added `ApprovalRequired` variant (non-breaking: exhaustive match warning only)
- Context reducer applies as a view before API calls; full history preserved in agent state

### Migration Guide
- `hook_decision` match expressions will emit warning 8 for missing `ApprovalRequired` case. Add the case or use wildcard.
- New `Agent.create` optional params: `?tracer`, `?approval`, `?context_reducer` (all default to no-op/None)

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- `Structured` module: typed structured output extraction via tool_use + tool_choice=Tool pattern
- Token budget tracking: `max_input_tokens` and `max_total_tokens` fields in `agent_config`
- Token budget enforcement in agent run loop (per-turn check before API call)
- Property-based tests using QCheck (model/role/param_type round-trip, usage commutativity)
- Test coverage for structured output extraction and token budget logic

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: `MessageStart` and `MessageDelta` SSE event usage type changed from `(int * int) option` to `api_usage option`
- Streaming SSE parser now extracts `cache_creation_input_tokens` and `cache_read_input_tokens` from `message_start` events
- `create_message_stream` accumulates cache tokens in usage stats

### Migration Guide
- `MessageStart { usage = Some (inp, out) }` → `MessageStart { usage = Some { input_tokens; output_tokens; cache_creation_input_tokens; cache_read_input_tokens } }`
- `MessageDelta { usage = Some (inp, out) }` → same pattern
- New `agent_config` fields have `None` defaults (backward compatible for config construction)

## [0.3.2] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- `Session` module for conversation persistence (save/load JSON)
- `Skill` module for reusable agent capability bundles
- `Subagent` module for spawning child agents with isolated context
- Test hardening: 106+ unit tests across 15 test files
- `replace_tool_result` bug fix in `Agent` module

### Changed
- README synced to v0.3.1 feature set (prompt caching status corrected)

## [0.3.1] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- Prompt caching: `cache_system_prompt` config option wraps system prompt with `cache_control` ephemeral
- `api_usage` record type with `cache_creation_input_tokens` and `cache_read_input_tokens` fields
- `usage_stats` accumulates cache token counts across turns

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: `api_response.usage` type changed from `(int * int) option` to `api_usage option`
- **BREAKING**: `add_usage` accepts `api_usage` record instead of two ints
- `usage_stats` cache fields renamed to `total_cache_creation_input_tokens` / `total_cache_read_input_tokens` for consistency
- `create_agent` convenience function now accepts `?cache_system_prompt`

### Known Limitations
- Streaming mode (`create_message_stream`) reports cache tokens as 0. SSE event types still use `(int * int) option` for usage. Full streaming cache support planned for v0.4.0.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-05
