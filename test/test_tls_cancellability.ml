(** RFC-OAS-026 §10.1 regression guard: TLS read cancellability.

    [test_eio_cancellability.ml] proves [Eio.Time.with_timeout_exn]
    interrupts [Eio.Buf_read.line] over a RAW TCP loopback flow. Every
    production https provider (ollama.com, api.anthropic.com, ...) runs
    the same [Buf_read.line] over a TLS-wrapped flow. RFC-OAS-026 §10.1
    flags it as medium-confidence/unverified that [with_timeout_exn]
    cancellation actually propagates into a [single_read] blocked inside
    a TLS session — the TLS layer may buffer or hold the read in a way
    that does not propagate cancellation to the underlying socket.

    If TLS read cancellation does NOT propagate, the OAS stream-idle
    deadline (RFC-OAS-026 F1) is armed at the typed-error layer but the
    physical interrupt never lands — a stalled https stream hangs past
    the configured idle deadline. This test wraps the slow-drip server
    in TLS (self-signed cert) and asserts the timeout still fires within
    tolerance, so a future Eio/tls-eio bump that breaks TLS cancellation
    fails CI instead of silently regressing into a keeper hang.

    Budget 2.0s; overshoot must stay under [overshoot_tolerance_s]
    (slightly higher than the raw-TCP test to absorb TLS handshake +
    record-buffering overhead). *)
