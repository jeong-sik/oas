(* test_agent_cancellation_tla_parity.ml

   OCaml mirror predicate for the AgentCancellation.tla spec.
   Validates that Runtime.phase values align with the TLA+ model:
   - 8-state alphabet
   - 3 terminal phases (Completed, Failed, Cancelled)
   - TerminalIsStable: terminal -> non-terminal is disallowed
   - CancelledRequiresSignal: implied by construction (Cancelled is terminal)

   Reference: specs/AgentCancellation.tla
