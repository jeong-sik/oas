(** The armed SSE deadline must be anchored to the last PAYLOAD-bearing line,
    not to the last line read.

    [Llm_provider.Http_client.read_sse] consumes keepalive comments inside one
    [with_timeout_exn] window so a comment-only stream still trips its budget.
    Three other line shapes carry no payload and used to escape that window,
    each one arming a fresh full budget: [id]/[retry] fields, unknown field
    names, and bare blank dispatch delimiters. A provider emitting one of them
    just under each budget could hold a stream open indefinitely without ever
    producing an event.

    These tests drive a mock clock from inside the mock flow's read, so they
    assert the deadline arithmetic itself with no wall-clock sleeping. *)
