(** Regression test for SSE keepalive comment handling in
    [Llm_provider.Http_client.read_sse].

    Per the W3C EventSource spec, lines starting with [':'] are
    comments / keepalives and carry no event payload.  They must
    not trigger [on_data] callbacks and (in the timeout-aware code
    path) must not reset the idle deadline — otherwise a provider
    emitting only keepalives would never trip [idle_timeout] and the
    stream would only terminate on the upstream consumer's hard cap.

    This test pins the [on_data] skip invariant via in-memory
    payloads.  The deadline-preservation invariant is guaranteed by
    the structural fact that keepalive skipping happens inside the
    same [Eio.Time.with_timeout_exn] window (a single inner recursion
    in [read_sse], not a fresh timeout per line). *)
